Investigate reliable methods for initial setup (cloning/submodule add) and ongoing updates (pull/fetch/reset/submodule update), including conflict detection/handling. Consider scenarios where '.cursor' is a direct clone vs. a submodule. Focus on improving robustness and clarity compared to current 'system-prompt.mdc' Section 1. Use external search and documentation tools as needed."
