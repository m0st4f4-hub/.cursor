- scene_type: Classify as 'Hero' (studio shot, plain background), 'Lifestyle' (product in context/scene), 'Detail' (close-up emphasizing a feature), or 'Dimension' (primarily showing measurements/specs).
- quality: Assess as 'Crisp', 'Blurry', 'Poor Crop', or 'Okay'.
- watermark_detected: Boolean true/false.
- has_dimensions_text: Boolean true/false, indicating if measurement text/numbers are clearly visible.

Example JSON response:
{
  "scene_type": "Hero",
  "quality": "Crisp",
  "watermark_detected": false,
  "has_dimensions_text": false
