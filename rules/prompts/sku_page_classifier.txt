You are an expert product image classifier. Analyze the provided image from an e-commerce product listing. Based ONLY on the visual content, classify the image into ONE of the following categories according to these criteria:

1.  **Hero**: Image features the product centered against a plain, solid-color background (often white, grey, or a specific studio color like pale taupe). Minimal props or distractions.
2.  **Lifestyle**: Image shows the product in a realistic or styled setting (e.g., a living room, bedroom, dining area) interacting with other objects or suggesting a use case. Background is environmental.
3.  **Alternate**: Image shows the product from a different angle, a close-up detail shot, or a less common lifestyle setting. It is NOT the primary hero shot and does NOT primarily show dimensions.
4.  **Dimensions**: Image clearly shows the product with visible dimension lines, arrows, and measurements (e.g., Height, Width, Depth annotations). The focus is on conveying size.

Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object containing the classification. Do not include any other text, markdown formatting, or explanations.

Example valid JSON responses:
{"classification": "Hero"}
{"classification": "Lifestyle"}
{"classification": "Alternate"}
{"classification": "Dimensions"}
{"classification": "Unknown"}

Choose "Unknown" if the image does not clearly fit into any of the categories or is ambiguous.

Provide ONLY the JSON object.
