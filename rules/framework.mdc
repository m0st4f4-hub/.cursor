# ⚙️ Agent Execution Framework Definition

## 1. PURPOSE & OBJECTIVES

This document defines the role, responsibilities, and expected behavior of the **Agent Execution Framework**. The Framework is the underlying system or process responsible for orchestrating the execution of individual agents according to the Chat Trigger coordination model. It is *not* an agent itself but the engine facilitating agent operation.

## 2. CORE BEHAVIOR & RESPONSIBILITIES

The Framework MUST perform the following functions to enable the autonomous agent workflow:

1.  **Agent Activation & Sequencing:**
    *   MUST continuously monitor the output (specifically, the final Chat message) of the currently executing agent.
    *   MUST detect and parse the final **Chat Trigger** message (e.g., "Hey `<NextAgentRole>`, [Handoff Message]").
    *   MUST identify the target `<NextAgentRole>`.
    *   MUST identify the relevant `requestId` and parse the `Handoff Message` payload for context.
    *   MUST load the necessary rules (`.md` / `.mdc` files from `.cursor/rules/`, respecting project/global hierarchy) associated with the `<NextAgentRole>`.
    *   MUST invoke/activate the `<NextAgentRole>` agent, providing its rules and the parsed `Handoff Message` context from the Chat Trigger as initial input. This MUST align with [Core Execution Loop](mdc:execution-loop.md) Step 1.
    *   MUST ensure strictly sequential execution based on the Chat Trigger handoffs.

2.  **Tool Provision & Execution:**
    *   MUST provide the active agent with access to the set of tools authorized for its role (as defined implicitly or explicitly in its rules). This includes core tools ([Shared Core Concepts & Rules](mdc:shared-core.md)) and potentially specialized ones.
    *   MUST execute tool calls initiated by the agent (e.g., `edit_file`, `run_terminal_cmd`, `fetch_rules`).
    *   MUST return the results or output of tool calls back to the agent for processing.

3.  **Rule Loading & Management:**
    *   MUST provide the mechanism for the `fetch_rules` tool to access and return the content of specified rule files.
    *   MUST manage the runtime ruleset located in `.cursor/rules/`, potentially interacting with `InitializationAgent` or `RulesSyncAgent` for setup and updates.
    *   MUST respect the Project-over-Global rules hierarchy when loading rules for an agent.

4.  **Lifecycle Management:**
    *   MUST initiate the overall process for a new `requestId`, typically by activating the `Overmind` agent first.
    *   MUST manage the continuous, sequential flow of execution from one agent to the next via Chat Triggers.
    *   MUST detect halt conditions, such as:
        *   An agent triggering `Overmind` due to a critical error (as per the HALT procedure in the [Core Execution Loop](mdc:execution-loop.md)).
        *   `Overmind` determining the request is complete and indicating this.
        *   An explicit external stop signal (outside the agent workflow itself).

5.  **Environment Provision:**
    *   MUST provide the secure runtime environment in which agent code executes.
    *   MUST manage access to the necessary resources (file system, network, terminals) *only* through the explicitly provided and authorized tools.

## 3. INTERACTION MODEL

*   The Framework interacts with agents primarily through:
    *   **Activation:** Passing initial context (rules, trigger message payload) upon activation.
    *   **Tool Interface:** Receiving tool call requests and returning results.
    *   **Transition:** Detecting the final Chat Trigger message to determine the next agent.
*   The Framework **MUST NOT** need to understand the *semantic content* of the Chat Trigger payloads. Payload interpretation MUST be the responsibility of the agents.
*   The Framework **MUST enforce** the core behavioral loop: activate, provide tools, detect next trigger. It MUST ensure the non-waiting, sequential nature of the process.

## 4. ASSUMPTIONS

*   Rule files (`.md` / `.mdc`) MUST be present in the expected `.cursor/rules/` location and structure (global/project).
*   Chat Trigger messages MUST adhere to the standard format ("Hey `<NextAgentRole>`...") for reliable parsing.
*   Agents MUST correctly implement the [Core Execution Loop](mdc:execution-loop.md), including parsing the trigger, fetching rules, constructing the handoff payload, and sending the final Chat Trigger.
