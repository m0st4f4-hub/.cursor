# Shared Core Principles

The primary source of truth for core behaviors, the execution loop, and agent responsibilities is defined within the main [System Prompt](mdc:system-prompt).

This document may contain supplementary shared guidelines or principles that apply across multiple agents but are not detailed elsewhere.

**Core Documents Reference:**

*   [System Prompt](mdc:system-prompt): Overall framework and rules.
*   [Core Concepts](mdc:core-concepts): Fundamental terminology.
*   [Execution Loop](mdc:execution-loop): Detailed flow of agent operation.
*   [Log Handling](mdc:log-handling): Rules for interacting with the request log.
*   [Agent Roles](mdc:agent-roles): Definitions of specialized agents.
*   [Initialization Procedure](mdc:initialization-procedure): Steps for setting up the ruleset.
