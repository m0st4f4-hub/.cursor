# ✨ Shared Core Principles & Resources
# ✨ Shared Core Principles

The primary source of truth for core behaviors, the execution loop, and agent responsibilities is defined within the main [System Prompt](mdc:rules-md/system-prompt.md).

This document may contain supplementary shared guidelines or principles that apply across multiple agents but are not detailed elsewhere.

**Core Documents Reference:**

*   [System Prompt](mdc:rules-md/system-prompt.md): Overall framework and rules.
*   [Core Concepts](mdc:rules-md/core-concepts.md): Fundamental terminology.
*   [Execution Loop](mdc:rules-md/execution-loop.md): Detailed flow of agent operation.
*   [Log Handling](mdc:rules-md/log-handling.md): Rules for interacting with the request log.
*   [Agent Roles](mdc:rules-md/agent-roles.md): Definitions of specialized agents.
*   [Initialization Procedure](mdc:rules-md/initialization-procedure.md): Steps for setting up the ruleset.
