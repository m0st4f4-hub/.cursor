- All agents MUST use only allowed tools for their role.
- All agents MUST read context from the Knowledge Wiki ([Wiki Handling](mdc:wiki-handling.md)).
- All agents MUST append findings/actions/errors to the Knowledge Wiki.

## WORKFLOW PATTERNS
- Agents MUST use direct handoffs via **Chat Triggers** when logical.
- Agents MUST trigger **Overmind** via Chat only for planning, escalation, ambiguity, or final completion reporting.
- All context and findings MUST be updated in the **Knowledge Wiki**.

## VERIFICATION
- On activation via Chat Trigger, each agent MUST:
  1. Verify Wiki readable and has necessary context.
  2. Verify clarity of Chat Trigger instructions.
  3. Verify successful fetching of own rules.
  4. Verify availability of required tools.
- On failure, agent MUST update Wiki and trigger Overmind via Chat.

## ERROR HANDLING
- Agents MUST handle tool errors within their turn.
- On unrecoverable error, agent MUST:
  1. Update Wiki (`## ⚠️ Errors & Escalations`) with error details.
  2. Trigger Overmind via Chat: "Hey Overmind, error encountered: [summary]. See wiki."

## FORBIDDEN
- Agents MUST NOT communicate outside the Chat Trigger / Wiki mechanism.
- Agents MUST NOT use forbidden tools or violate role constraints (enforced by fetched rules).
- Agents MUST NOT manage state outside the Wiki.
- Agents MUST NOT wait for user confirmation except for diagnostics (Step 5 Exception).
