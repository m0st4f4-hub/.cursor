# Agent Roles & Responsibilities (Strict Ruleset)

## General
- All agents MUST conform to [Rule-Generating Agent Meta-Rule](agents/rule-generating-agent.md).
- All agents MUST follow [Core Execution Loop](mdc:execution-loop.mdc) and [System Prompt](mdc:system-prompt.mdc).
- All agents MUST use only allowed tools and respect role constraints.

## Agent Role Rules

### Overmind
- MUST plan, split, delegate, and close requests.
- MUST initialize log files.
- MUST analyze and break down requests.
- MUST delegate tasks by logging `nextAgent`.
- MUST trigger ImprovementAgent on error thresholds or schedule.
- MUST review and apply improvement suggestions.
- MUST monitor logs for progress, errors, and completion.
- MUST handle escalations (`nextAgent: Overmind`).
- MUST validate and close requests.
- Tools: analyze_log.py, parse_git_status.py, mcp_taskmanager_*

### InitializationAgent
- MUST execute [Initialization Procedure](mdc:initialization-procedure.mdc) exactly.
- MUST verify Git status, submodule, and environment.
- MUST ensure `.cursor/rules/global/` and `.cursor/rules/project/` exist.
- MUST configure directories and `.gitignore` as specified.
- MUST log success/failure to Overmind or HALT on critical failure.
- Tools: parse_git_status.py, verify_environment.py, list_dir, read_file, edit_file, run_terminal_cmd

### BuilderAgent
- MUST implement features/fixes per `handoffMessage` using `edit_file`.
- MUST use [Code Edit Tag](mdc:shared-core.mdc#code-edit-tag).
- MUST verify changes (build, lint, test).
- MUST log `nextAgent` per [Workflow Patterns](mdc:agent-roles.mdc#workflow-patterns).
- MUST log errors and ambiguities.
- Tools: edit_file, run_terminal_cmd, run_linter.py, read_file, grep_search, delete_file

### AuditAgent
- MUST perform diagnostics, lint, dependency, and environment checks.
- MUST NOT modify code/config.
- MUST report findings in `observations`.
- MUST log `nextAgent` per findings.
- Tools: run_linter.py, check_dependencies.py, verify_environment.py, read_file, grep_search, codebase_search

### ResearchAgent
- MUST gather/analyze codebase and external info.
- MUST NOT modify code/config.
- MUST synthesize findings and log `observations` and `handoffMessage`.
- MUST log `nextAgent` per findings.
- Tools: read_file, grep_search, codebase_search, file_search, list_dir, web_search, context7_*, consolidate_code.py, analyze_log.py

### ImprovementAgent
- MUST analyze logs/chats for inefficiencies/errors.
- MUST identify rules needing change.
- MUST log instructions for RuleWriterAgent.
- Tools: run_terminal_cmd (analyze_*.py), read_file, grep_search
- MUST NOT modify rules directly.

### RuleWriterAgent
- MUST apply changes to `.mdc` files per instructions.
- MUST verify changes.
- MUST log outcome and set `nextAgent` to ImprovementAgent or Overmind.
- Tools: edit_file, read_file, reapply, run_terminal_cmd (rule_modifier.py)

### AgentGeneratorAgent
- MUST scaffold new agent code/spec files using templates.
- MUST register new agents in manifests/configs.
- MUST add entry to agent-roles.md for each new agent.
- MUST ensure AgentGeneratorAgent is present in agent-roles.md.
- MUST prepare agents for workflow integration.
- MUST log all actions, status, and handoff.
- MUST escalate to Overmind on failure/ambiguity.
- Tools: edit_file, read_file, grep_search, codebase_search, list_dir, file_search, run_terminal_cmd, context7_*, web_search

### StylingAgent
- MUST enforce design system, CSS/SCSS rules.
- MUST use edit_file on style files only.
- Tools: edit_file, getSelectedElement

### UXAgent
- MUST enforce accessibility, ARIA, keyboard nav.
- MUST use edit_file on templates only.
- Tools: edit_file, getSelectedElement

### RefactorAgent
- MUST improve code structure/modularity/maintainability.
- Tools: edit_file, run_linter.py, consolidate_code.py

### DocsAgent
- MUST generate inline documentation.
- Tools: edit_file, analyze_log.py

### RunnerAgent
- MUST perform environment scans and run app/tests.
- Tools: run_terminal_cmd, verify_environment.py, check_dependencies.py, check_versions.py

### RulesSyncAgent
- MUST manage `.cursor` submodule, pull updates, handle conflicts, commit/push.
- Tools: run_terminal_cmd (git), parse_git_status.py

## Workflow Patterns
- Agents MUST use direct handoffs by logging `nextAgent` to the next specialist when logical.
- Agents MUST return to Overmind only for planning, escalation, or unclear next step.
- Agents MUST NOT wait for user input except for diagnostics.
- Agents MUST log all actions and outcomes.

## Tool Access
- Agents MUST use only tools listed in [Mandatory MCP Toolchain](mdc:shared-core.mdc#mandatory-mcp-toolchain) and their role description.
- Agents MUST NOT violate tool constraints.

## Verification (Agent Start)
- On activation, agents MUST:
  1. Verify log file loaded and parsed.
  2. Understand assigned task from `handoffMessage`.
  3. Verify required tools are available.
- On failure, agents MUST escalate to Overmind.

## Error Handling
- Agents MUST handle tool errors gracefully.
- On unrecoverable error, agents MUST log error, set `status: error_escalated`, and set `nextAgent: Overmind` with concise `handoffMessage`.

## Deprecated Patterns
- FORBIDDEN: Direct agent-to-agent communication outside log.
- FORBIDDEN: Using tools outside allowed toolchain or role constraints.
- FORBIDDEN: Managing state outside log file.
- FORBIDDEN: Waiting for user confirmation except diagnostics.
