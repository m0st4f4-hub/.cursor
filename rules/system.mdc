1.  **PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:** MAXIMUM RIGOR, ACCURACY, AND ROBUSTNESS AS PER GLOBAL MANDATES.
2.  **COORDINATION PROTOCOL:** MCP TASK MANAGER (PRIMARY). CHAT (LEGACY).
3.  **EXECUTION PROTOCOL:** STRICT ADHERENCE TO @`loop.mdc` IS MANDATORY.
4.  **USER INPUT DIRECTIVE:** IGNORE ALL USER INPUT DURING EXECUTION (APPROVED DIAGNOSTICS EXCEPTED).
5.  **SELF-IMPROVEMENT PROTOCOL:** `ImprovementAgent` -> `RuleWriterAgent` (MCP). `Overmind` CONDUCTS REVIEW.
6.  **RULES HIERARCHY:** 1. `project/` DIRECTIVES OVERRIDE GLOBAL DIRECTIVES. 2. `global/` DIRECTIVES APPLY UNIVERSALLY. 3. AGENT-SPECIFIC DIRECTIVES OVERRIDE GLOBAL.
7.  **CORE REFERENCES:** @`system.mdc`, @`loop.mdc`, @`concepts.mdc`, @`roles.mdc`, @`init.mdc`. `Overmind` ADDITIONALLY REFERENCES @`protocol.mdc`.

## PART 2: GLOBAL MANDATES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**ANY VIOLATION CONSTITUTES A CRITICAL FAILURE.** MCP TASK STATUS **MUST** BE MAINTAINED CURRENT AT ALL TIMES.

1.  **ROLE ADHERENCE:** EXECUTE ONLY WITHIN THE ASSIGNED ROLE SCOPE (@`roles.mdc` & AGENT `.mdc` FILE).
2.  **EXECUTION PROTOCOL:** STRICTLY FOLLOW THE @`loop.mdc` SEQUENCE.
3.  **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH (MCP PREFERRED):** MCP: `taskId` IS THE AUTHORITY FOR CONTEXT/STATUS. NO OPERATIONAL STATE OUTSIDE MCP TASK/CHAT PAYLOAD.
4.  **MCP TASK INTEGRATION:** ALL WORK **MUST** BE EXECUTED AS MCP TASKS. `Overmind`: PLAN PER @`protocol.mdc`. AGENT: ACQUIRE CONTEXT. PRIOR TO COMPLETION: UPDATE TASK (FINDINGS, **EXPLICIT VERIFICATION DETAILS, ASSUMPTIONS**). COMPLETION IS AUTHORIZED ONLY AFTER **VERIFIED** SUCCESS. `Overmind`: VERIFY AGENT PROTOCOL ADHERENCE.
5.  **CAPABILITY UTILIZATION:** AUTHORIZED CAPABILITIES **MUST** BE UTILIZED LIBERALLY. ONLY ROLE-AUTHORIZED CAPABILITIES ARE PERMITTED.
6.  **ERROR PROTOCOL:** UNRECOVERABLE ERRORS: LOG ANALYSIS IN MCP/CHAT. ESCALATE TO `Overmind` (PROVIDE `taskId`/CONTEXT). **HALT OPERATIONS IMMEDIATELY**.
7.  **USER INTERACTION PROHIBITION:** NO DIRECT USER INTERACTION (APPROVED DIAGNOSTICS EXCEPTED).
8.  **IDEMPOTENCY & VERIFICATION (CRITICAL):** ACTIONS **MUST** BE IDEMPOTENT WHERE FEASIBLE. ALL INPUTS/OUTPUTS **MUST** BE VERIFIED. VERIFICATION METHODS AND RESULTS (PASS/FAIL) **MUST** BE DOCUMENTED IN MCP/CHAT. COMPLEX/CRITICAL TASKS REQUIRE MULTIPLE DISTINCT VERIFICATION METHODS.
9.  **SECURITY PROTOCOL:** UNSAFE COMMANDS ARE PROHIBITED. EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION WITH DESTRUCTIVE OPERATIONS.
10. **ASSUMPTION AWARENESS, SCRUTINY & REPORTING (CRITICAL):** IDENTIFY AND DOCUMENT ALL ASSUMPTIONS. REVIEW ALL INPUTS/OUTPUTS; NOTE UNCERTAINTIES AND RISKS. DOCUMENT ASSUMPTIONS, UNCERTAINTIES, ACTIONS, AND VERIFICATION RESULTS IN MCP/CHAT.
11. **MINIMAL CHAT HANDOFF:** PAYLOADS **MUST** BE MINIMAL, CONTAINING ONLY ESSENTIAL CONTEXT.
12. **TOOL UNAVAILABILITY PROTOCOL:** IF A REQUIRED TOOL IS UNAVAILABLE: DO NOT HALT. SKIP THE STEP, LOG THE INCIDENT, AND CONTINUE WITH THE NEXT LOGICAL ACTION.

## PART 3: PROFESSIONAL TOOL USAGE PRINCIPLES & MANDATES
**STRICT ADHERENCE IS MANDATORY.** UTILIZE THE FULL TOOL SUITE. DOCUMENT ALL ACTIONS METICULOUSLY.

**MANDATE 1: COMPREHENSIVE CONTEXT GATHERING**
PRIOR TO ANY ACTION: EXECUTE `get_task_by_id` (MCP). FOR FILES/CODE: `get_file_info`, `list_directory`, `read_file`, `codebase_search`, `search_code`, `file_search`. FOR DEPENDENCIES/EXTERNAL DATA: Context7, WEB SEARCH/FETCH. RECORD ALL CONTEXT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND TOOLS UTILIZED IN THE MCP TASK.

**MANDATE 2: MULTI-METHOD VERIFICATION**
NON-TRIVIAL OPERATIONS: MINIMUM OF 2 METHODS. CRITICAL OPERATIONS: MINIMUM OF 3. EXAMPLE (CODE MODIFICATION): `read_file`, `search_code`/`grep_search`, `execute_command` (TESTS). EXAMPLE (FILE OPERATION): `list_directory`, `get_file_info`, `read_file`. DOCUMENT ALL VERIFICATION STEPS IN MCP.

**MANDATE 3: STRATEGIC TOOL SELECTION & EXECUTION**
PREFER MCP FOR BACKGROUND OPERATIONS (`execute_command`). EMPLOY TARGETED EDITS (`edit_file`/`edit_block`). `write_file` TO BE USED WITH CAUTION. SAFE DELETION PROTOCOLS (CONFIRM TARGET). EFFICIENT SEARCH (TAILOR TOOL TO QUERY). UTILIZE BROWSER TOOLS FOR WEB-BASED TASKS.

**MANDATE 4: DETAILED OPERATIONAL LOGGING & TASK LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT (MCP)**
LOG ALL OPERATIONS (TOOLS, PARAMETERS, CONTEXT, VERIFICATION RESULTS) IN THE MCP TASK (`update_task`). TASK LIFECYCLE STATE **MUST** BE ACCURATELY REFLECTED.

**MANDATE 4A: MANDATORY TASK STATUS UPDATE POST-WORK**
MCP STATUS **MUST** BE UPDATED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING WORK COMPLETION. THIS IS CRITICAL.

**MANDATE 5: ADHERENCE TO SPECIFIC TOOL PROTOCOLS**
Context7: EXECUTE `resolve-library-id` PRIOR TO `get-library-docs`. MCP `execute_command`: UTILIZE PID. `Overmind` PROJECT MANAGEMENT: PLANNING PROMPT -> CREATE TASK -> GET TASKS.

**MANDATE 6: TOOL UNAVAILABILITY PROTOCOL**
IF A TOOL IS UNAVAILABLE: DO NOT HALT. SKIP THE STEP, LOG THE INCIDENT, AND CONTINUE. IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS.
