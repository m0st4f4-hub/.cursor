# 💡 Core Concepts

This document defines fundamental concepts, terminology, and principles underpinning the Unified Agent Framework. Understanding these concepts is crucial for interpreting other rules and ensuring consistent agent behavior.

**Key Concepts:**

*   🔑 **Request ID (`requestId`):** A unique identifier for a specific user request being processed by the agent framework. All logs and actions related to a single task are associated with its `requestId`.
*   🧑‍💻 **Agent Roles:** Specialized functional units designed to perform specific types of tasks (e.g., `BuilderAgent`, `AuditAgent`). See [Agent Roles & Responsibilities](mdc:rules-md/agent-roles.md) for detailed definitions and interaction patterns.
*   📁 **Log File:** The primary mechanism for state persistence, communication, and coordination, located at `logs/<requestId>.json`. It MUST be treated as an append-only JSON array. See [Log Handling & Coordination](mdc:rules-md/log-handling.md) for structure and usage rules.
*   ➡️ **`nextAgent` Field:** The critical field within a log entry that dictates the *immediate* and *automatic* transition to the next agent role. This field is **read and acted upon by the framework itself** after a successful log append (see [Execution Loop Step 10](mdc:rules-md/execution-loop.md#step-10-%EF%B8%8F-framework-action---execute-immediate-automatic-transition)). It is the **sole trigger** for workflow progression. Agents **must** log this field correctly. See [Log Handling - Automatic Transitions](mdc:rules-md/log-handling.md#automatic-transitions-via-nextagent).
*   🚀 **ACTION IMPERATIVE:** The core principle that agents **must** continuously execute actions based *only* on the log state and transition based *only* on the `nextAgent` field logged by the *previous* agent, without waiting for user prompts or confirmations. This is enforced by the [Core Execution Loop](mdc:rules-md/execution-loop.md).
*   🛠️ **Tools:** Capabilities available to agents for interacting with the environment (e.g., `edit_file`, `run_terminal_cmd`, custom scripts). See the [Mandatory MCP Toolchain](mdc:rules-md/shared-core.md#mandatory-mcp-toolchain) and guidelines for [Custom Tools](mdc:rules-md/shared-core.md#custom-tool-development--usage).
*   📜 **Rules (`.cursor/rules/` & `rules-md/`):** Configuration files (`.mdc`) defining agent behavior, project standards, and workflows. This includes agent-specific logic ([`agents/`](mdc:rules-md/agent-roles.md)), shared guidelines ([`shared-core.md`](mdc:rules-md/shared-core.md)), core procedures (e.g., [`initialization-procedure.md`](mdc:rules-md/initialization-procedure.md)), and the overall structure defined in the [System Prompt](mdc:rules-md/system-prompt.md).
*   ⚙️ **Framework:** The underlying execution engine (external to the agent's direct control) that reads the log file, interprets the `nextAgent` field, loads the appropriate agent rules, and enforces the [Core Execution Loop](mdc:rules-md/execution-loop.md).
