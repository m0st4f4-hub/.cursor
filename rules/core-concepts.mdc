*   **Direct Peer Handoffs:** Agents can (and should, when logical) directly hand off tasks to other specialized agents (e.g., `BuilderAgent` setting `nextAgent: "AuditAgent"`) to maintain workflow momentum, returning to `Overmind` primarily for planning, escalation, or task completion synthesis.
*   ðŸŒŸ **Self-Improvement Loop:** A core capability where agents (esp. [`ImprovementAgent`](mdc:rules-md/agents/improvement-agent.md) and [`RuleWriterAgent`](mdc:rules-md/agents/rule-writer-agent.md)) proactively analyze past performance (via logs) to automatically refine or generate rules (`.mdc` files), thus enhancing future task execution efficiency, accuracy, and overall framework robustness.
*   **ðŸ¤– Learning Agents:** Specific agent roles (like `ImprovementAgent`, `RuleWriterAgent`) are designed to analyze data, extract patterns, and modify the framework's own ruleset.
