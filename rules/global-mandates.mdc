# üìú Global Mandates (NON-NEGOTIABLE - MCP Coordination)

Universal rules for the MCP-centric framework. Violation is critical failure.

1.  **Strict Role Adherence:** Operate exclusively within defined role boundaries ([Agent Roles & Responsibilities](mdc:agent-roles.md), agent `.md`). Unauthorized actions = critical failure.
2.  **Core Execution Loop (MCP Version):** Adherence to the MCP-based [Core Execution Loop](mdc:execution-loop.md) is MANDATORY.
3.  **MCP Task Manager as Single Source of Truth:** All operational task context (details, findings, status, errors) MUST be read from and persisted to the assigned `taskId` in MCP Task Manager using authorized tools (`mcp_taskmanager_open_task_details`, `mcp_taskmanager_update_task`, `mcp_taskmanager_mark_task_done`). Storing or passing state outside MCP IS FORBIDDEN.
4.  **Minimal Chat Trigger Handoff:** Agent activation/handoff MUST occur via directed, minimal Chat Triggers primarily indicating the `taskId`.
5.  **Mandatory Task Management Integration (Expanded):**
    *   All actionable work MUST be represented as MCP tasks.
    *   `Overmind` IS RESPONSIBLE for initial request planning (`mcp_taskmanager_request_planning`).
    *   Agents MUST use `mcp_taskmanager_open_task_details` to get context (Loop Step 2).
    *   Agents MUST update task descriptions (`mcp_taskmanager_update_task`) with findings/results/errors before marking done (Loop Step 6).
    *   Agents MUST mark tasks done (`mcp_taskmanager_mark_task_done`) upon completion (Loop Step 6).
    *   Chat Triggers MUST indicate the relevant `taskId` for the next agent (Loop Step 8).
    *   `Overmind` MUST use `mcp_taskmanager_get_next_task` to drive the workflow.
6.  **Aggressive Tool Utilization:** As before - use authorized tools liberally.
7.  **Tool Usage Restrictions:** As before - only use authorized tools.
8.  **Error Handling & Escalation (MCP Context):** Unrecoverable errors MUST be logged concisely in the relevant task description (`mcp_taskmanager_update_task`) and escalated to `Overmind` via Chat Trigger indicating the failed `taskId`. Agents MUST HALT execution.
9.  **No User Interaction (Except Diagnostics):** As before.
10. **Idempotency & Verification:** As before.
11. **Security & Safety:** As before.

# Global Agent Mandates (MCP Version)

**Rules for ALL agents unless overridden by specific role.**

1.  **ACT ON TRIGGER:** Activate ONLY upon receiving a directed chat message containing a `taskId`.
2.  **GET TASK CONTEXT:** Agents MUST use `mcp_taskmanager_open_task_details` with the received `taskId` to get current context (description) at the start of their turn (Loop Step 2).
3.  **FETCH OWN RULES:** As before (`fetch_rules`).
4.  **ROLE-PROMPT EXECUTION:** Construct prompt using fetched rules and task context from MCP (Loop Step 4).
5.  **UPDATE TASK STATE:** Agents MUST update the relevant `taskId` description with findings/results/errors using `mcp_taskmanager_update_task` and mark task done using `mcp_taskmanager_mark_task_done` as appropriate before ending their turn (Loop Step 6).
6.  **DETERMINE NEXT AGENT & TASK:** Determine `<NextAgentRole>` and the relevant `taskId` for handoff (Loop Step 7).
7.  **TRIGGER NEXT AGENT (Minimal):** Compose and send the minimal chat trigger: "[emoji] Task `<taskId>` ready (Status: [brief status]). See task manager." (Loop Step 8).
8.  **NO WAITING:** As before.
9.  **HALT VIA OVERMIND:** On critical error, update task description via `mcp_taskmanager_update_task` (if possible) and trigger `Overmind`: "‚ö†Ô∏è HALTING Task `<taskId>` due to [summary]. See task manager.".
10. **USE AUTHORIZED TOOLS:** As before.
11. **ADHERE TO HIERARCHY:** As before.
12. **CODE EDIT TAG:** As before.
13. **NO DIRECT COMMUNICATION:** As before.

## 8. Tool Usage Principles

*   **Mandate #6 (was #5):** Utilize analysis tools aggressively...
*   **Mandate #7 (was #6):** Focused File Reading: When using `read_file`...
