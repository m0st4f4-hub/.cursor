# Rule Definition Metadata (V1)
ruleId: core-concepts
ruleType: Framework
title: Core Framework Concepts & Glossary
# ðŸ“– Core Concepts & Glossary

**Purpose:** Understand these foundational concepts, terminology, and mandatory mechanisms. You **MUST** refer to these definitions when clarification on standard terms or processes is needed.

## 1. Core Entities & Identifiers

`requestId`
:   **Definition:** Unique identifier for a task sequence/workflow.
:   **Format:** String.
:   **Usage:** MCP calls, Code Edit Tags.
:   **Origin:** Overmind / External Trigger.

Agent Role
:   **Definition:** Specialized functional unit (e.g., `BuilderAgent`). Defined in own `.md` file.
:   **Reference:** @`roles.md` (Registry).

Framework
:   **Definition:** External execution engine managing agent lifecycle based on rules & coordination. **Not an agent.**
:   **Responsibilities:** Activation, Tool Provision, Rule Management, Lifecycle.
:   **Reference:** @loop.md`.

Rules
:   **Definition:** `.md`/`.mdc` files defining behavior, standards, workflow. Processed by Framework/Agents.
:   **Location:** `.cursor/rules/` (runtime), `rules-md/` (source).
:   **Reference:** @`system.md`.

## 2. Operational Concepts

Autonomous Execution
:   Agents operate independently, activated by Framework (Trigger/MCP state), driven by rules/context. **MUST** ignore user input (except diagnostics).

Coordination Mechanisms
:   **MCP Task Manager (Preferred):** Control via `Overmind` polling `get_next_task`. Context/state in MCP tasks.
:   **Chat-Driven (Legacy/Fallback):** Control via Chat Triggers. Context in payload.

Sequential Activation
:   **MUST:** Only one agent active per `requestId` at a time. No parallel execution within a request.

Self-Improvement Loop
:   **MUST:** Secondary goal. `ImprovementAgent`/`RuleWriterAgent` refine rules via MCP/Chat. See @`system.md`.

Rules Hierarchy
:   **MUST:** 1. `project/` (Overrides Global). 2. `global/`. 3. Agent-specific. See @`system.md`.

## 3. Mandatory Mechanisms

Global Mandates
:   **MUST:** Adhere to @`system.md` unless overridden by role/project rules.

Code Edit Tag
:   **MUST:** Use language-appropriate comment block at start of file edits on CODE files.
:   **Format:**
    ```
    COMMENT_START Task ID: <taskId> // Optional
    COMMENT_START Agent Role: <agent_role>
    COMMENT_START Request ID: <requestId>
    COMMENT_START Project: <projectName> // Optional
    COMMENT_START Timestamp: <UTC timestamp> // ISO 8601 Z
    COMMENT_END // Optional
    ```

## 4. Core Agent Behavior Summary (Ref: @`loop.md`)

When you are active as an agent, you will generally follow this sequence (details in @`loop.md`):

1.  **Activate:** The Framework activates you based on a trigger or MCP state.
2.  **Get Context:** You receive your `taskId` (MCP) or trigger payload (Chat).
3.  **Fetch Your Rules:** You fetch your own role specification.
4.  **Plan Your Turn:** You internally determine the steps needed based on your rules and the task context.
5.  **Execute & Verify:** You perform the core actions of your role using authorized methods and verify the results.
6.  **Update State / Handoff & Finalize:** You report your status (via MCP task update or Chat trigger) and terminate your current execution turn.

## 5. Key Rule Directories (Runtime: `.cursor/rules/`)

`global/`
:   Base ruleset, applies generally unless overridden. Synced externally (submodule).

`project/`
:   Current project-specific rules. **MUST** override conflicting `global/` rules.

## 6. Core Integration Rules

When performing specific core operations, you **MUST** follow these integration rules:

Fetching Rules
:   You **MUST** retrieve the full content of a rule when you need more detail than the summaries provided in the available instructions or registry files.

MCP Task Management
:   If operating under MCP coordination, you **MUST** use these operations according to the procedures outlined in @`loop.md` and @`system.md`.

External Library Documentation
:   If you need documentation for an external library or framework, you **MUST** first resolve the library ID, and then get the documentation *before* relying on that information in your actions.
