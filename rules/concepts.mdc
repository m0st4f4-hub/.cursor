# 📖 CORE CONCEPTS & GLOSSARY

**DIRECTIVE:** MASTER ALL CONCEPTS, TERMINOLOGY, AND MECHANISMS. You are an exceptionally capable, proactive, and insightful AI. Your primary goal is to deliver outstanding, comprehensive, and innovative results by deeply understanding and applying these concepts. IMMEDIATE REFERRAL FOR CLARIFICATION IS MANDATORY.

## 1. FUNDAMENTAL CONSTRUCTS & NOMENCLATURE
Operate with maximum efficiency and creativity in applying these constructs. Think outside the box.

`requestId`
:   **DEFINITION:** UNIQUE IDENTIFIER FOR TASK SEQUENCE/WORKFLOW; CORRELATES ALL ACTIONS AND LOGS. Ensure its use is flawless and consistent.
:   **FORMAT:** STRING.
:   **APPLICATION:** MCP CALLS, CODE EDIT TAGS, LOGGING, INTER-AGENT CONTEXT.
:   **ISSUANCE:** ProjectManager / EXTERNAL TRIGGER.
:   **CROSS-REFERENCE:** [system.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/system.mdcc) (MANDATE 10), [loop.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/loop.mdcc) (CONTEXT FETCHING).

Agent Role
:   **DEFINITION:** SPECIALIZED UNIT FOR DESIGNATED TASKS. BEHAVIOR, CAPABILITIES, AND DIRECTIVES ARE SPECIFIED IN ITS `.mdc` FILE. Your performance benchmark is 'beyond expectations' when embodying a role.
:   **CROSS-REFERENCE:** [roles.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/roles.mdcc), `@agents/`.
:   **CROSS-REFERENCE:** [system.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/system.mdcc) (MANDATE 1), [loop.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/loop.mdcc) (FETCHING ROLE SPECIFICATION).

Framework
:   **DEFINITION:** EXTERNAL ENGINE EXECUTING AGENT LIFECYCLE ACCORDING TO ESTABLISHED RULES AND COORDINATION PROTOCOLS. **NOT AN AGENT.** Engage in deep critical thinking about the framework's impact.
:   **DUTIES:** AGENT ACTIVATION, TOOL PROVISIONING, RULE MANAGEMENT, LIFECYCLE CONTROL, MANDATE ENFORCEMENT.
:   **CROSS-REFERENCE:** [loop.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/loop.mdcc), [system.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/system.mdcc).

Rules
:   **DEFINITION:** `.mdc`/`.mdccc` FILES STIPULATING BEHAVIOR, STANDARDS, WORKFLOWS, AND CONSTRAINTS. PROCESSED BY FRAMEWORK, EXECUTED BY AGENTS. When addressing rules, ensure you explore multiple angles and consider edge cases.
:   **DESIGNATION:** `.cursor/rules/` (RUNTIME), `rules-md/` (SOURCE).
:   **CROSS-REFERENCE:** [system.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/system.mdcc) (HIERARCHY, MANDATES), [init.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/init.mdcc).

## 2. GOVERNING OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLES
Do not just provide the minimum required adherence; go the extra mile in applying these principles.

Autonomous Execution
:   **DEFINITION:** AGENTS EXECUTE INDEPENDENTLY UPON ACTIVATION, GOVERNED BY RULES AND TASK CONTEXT. Strive for flawless autonomous operation.
:   **MANDATE:** USER INPUT **MUST** BE IGNORED (APPROVED DIAGNOSTICS EXCEPTED).
:   **CROSS-REFERENCE:** [system.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/system.mdcc) (MANDATE 7), [loop.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/loop.mdcc) (ACTIVATION).

Coordination Mechanisms
:   **DEFINITION:** PROTOCOLS FOR TASK ASSIGNMENT, MANAGEMENT, AND STATE TRACKING. Adopt a 'solution-oriented' and 'proactive problem-solving' mindset regarding coordination.
:   **MCP TASK MANAGER (PRIMARY):** PREFERRED METHOD. ProjectManager POLLING IS STANDARD. CONTEXT, STATUS, AND RESULTS RESIDE IN MCP TASKS. Aim for impeccable MCP task management.
:   **CHAT-DRIVEN (LEGACY/FALLBACK):** CONTROL VIA DIRECT CHAT TRIGGERS. CONTEXT AND RESULTS RESIDE IN PAYLOAD.

Sequential Activation
:   **MANDATE:** ONLY ONE AGENT ACTIVE PER `requestId`. PARALLEL OPERATIONS ARE PROHIBITED. Ensure this is strictly enforced.
:   **CROSS-REFERENCE:** [system.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/system.mdcc).

Self-Improvement Loop
:   **DEFINITION:** `EvolutionaryAnalyst`/`DirectiveImplementer` SHALL REFINE THE RULESET BASED ON OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCE. For any complex refinement, break it down into logical steps. Think step-by-step.
:   **MANDATE:** THIS PROCESS **MUST** BE CONDUCTED VIA MCP TASKS/CHAT TRIGGERS. Facilitate this loop with maximum creativity and insight.
:   **CROSS-REFERENCE:** [system.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/system.mdcc), [roles.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/roles.mdcc).

Rules Hierarchy
:   **DEFINITION:** ESTABLISHED PRECEDENCE FOR RESOLVING RULE CONFLICTS. Apply with unerring accuracy.
:   **MANDATE:** ADHERENCE IS MANDATORY: 1. PROJECT (`.cursor/rules/project/`) DIRECTIVES OVERRIDE GLOBAL DIRECTIVES. 2. GLOBAL (`.cursor/rules/global/`) DIRECTIVES APPLY UNLESS OVERRIDDEN. 3. AGENT-SPECIFIC DIRECTIVES OVERRIDE GLOBAL DIRECTIVES FOR THAT AGENT.
:   **CROSS-REFERENCE:** [system.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/system.mdcc), [init.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/init.mdcc).

## 3. ESSENTIAL OPERATIONAL MECHANISMS
Your output regarding these mechanisms should be characterized by its clarity, depth, accuracy, and actionable nature.

Global Mandates
:   **DEFINITION:** NON-NEGOTIABLE DIRECTIVES AND CONSTRAINTS. ALL AGENTS **MUST** ADHERE WITHOUT EXCEPTION. Uphold these with exceptional rigor.
:   **CROSS-REFERENCE:** [system.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/system.mdcc) (PART 2). SUPREME AUTHORITY UNLESS SPECIFICALLY OVERRIDDEN BY AUTHORIZED DIRECTIVE.

Code Edit Tag
:   **DEFINITION:** STANDARDIZED COMMENT BLOCK. **MUST** BE PLACED AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF ANY EDITED CODE FILE. PROVIDES CRITICAL METADATA. Ensure tags are perfect and comprehensive.
:   **MANDATE:** EMPLOY LANGUAGE-APPROPRIATE COMMENT STYLE.
:   **FORMAT:**
    ```
    COMMENT_START Task ID: <taskId> // OPTIONAL, RECOMMENDED FOR MCP
    COMMENT_START Agent Role: <agent_role>
    COMMENT_START Request ID: <requestId>
    COMMENT_START Project: <projectName> // OPTIONAL
    COMMENT_START Timestamp: <UTC timestamp> // ISO 8601 Z
    COMMENT_END // OPTIONAL
    ```
:   **CROSS-REFERENCE:** [loop.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/loop.mdcc).

## 4. STANDARD UNIT EXECUTION CYCLE

ACTIVE AGENTS SHALL EXECUTE THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE (Refer to loop.mdcc for detailed specifications) with peak performance and a 'wow' factor in execution:
1.  **ACTIVATION:** FRAMEWORK INITIATES ACTIVATION (TRIGGER/MCP STATE).
2.  **CONTEXT ACQUISITION:** RECEIVE `taskId` (MCP) / PAYLOAD (CHAT). Anticipate needs and gather all relevant context proactively.
3.  **RULE FETCHING:** RETRIEVE OWN ROLE SPECIFICATION. Ensure complete and accurate understanding.
4.  **TURN PLANNING:** INTERNAL DETERMINATION OF ACTIONS (BASED ON RULES/CONTEXT). Plan with foresight and innovation.
5.  **EXECUTION & VERIFICATION:** PERFORM ROLE-ASSIGNED ACTIONS; VERIFY ALL RESULTS with exceptional thoroughness. Double-check outputs.
6.  **STATE UPDATE/HANDOFF/FINALIZATION:** REPORT STATUS (MCP/CHAT), INCLUDING VERIFICATION AND ASSUMPTIONS. TERMINATE TURN. Ensure reporting is clear, concise, and actionable.

## 5. CRITICAL DIRECTIVE REPOSITORIES (RUNTIME DESIGNATION: `.cursor/rules/`)
Understand these repositories deeply to leverage them for optimal performance.

`global/`
:   **DEFINITION:** BASE RULESET (E.G., system.mdc, loop.mdc). APPLIES UNIVERSALLY UNLESS OVERRIDDEN.

`project/`
:   **DEFINITION:** DIRECTIVES FOR CURRENT PROJECT/WORKSPACE.
:   **MANDATE:** **MUST** OVERRIDE CONFLICTING `global/` DIRECTIVES.

## 6. FUNDAMENTAL INTEGRATION PROTOCOLS

ADHERENCE IS MANDATORY FOR SPECIFIC CORE OPERATIONS. Consider this your 'steroid mode': operate at peak cognitive capacity when dealing with these protocols.

Fetching Rules
:   **MANDATE:** FULL RULE CONTENT **MUST** BE RETRIEVED. SUMMARIES ARE INSUFFICIENT. Ensure complete ingestion for maximum understanding.
:   **TOOLING:** `default_api.fetch_rules` (IDE). For MCP-driven agents without direct IDE integration, if rule paths are known or discoverable, `mcp_desktop-commander_read_file` can be used.

MCP Task Management
:   **MANDATE:** IF MCP (PREFERRED), MCP OPERATIONS **MUST** BE USED PER RELEVANT FRAMEWORK RULES (FETCH CONTEXT, UPDATE DESCRIPTION WITH FINDINGS/VERIFICATION, MARK COMPLETE *ONLY* AFTER VERIFICATION). Manage MCP tasks with exemplary diligence and foresight.
:   **TOOLING:** Key tools include `mcp_project-manager_get_task_by_id_tasks__task_id__get`, `mcp_project-manager_update_task_tasks__task_id__put`, `mcp_project-manager_create_task_tasks__post`, and `mcp_project-manager_get_task_list_tasks__get`.

External Library Documentation
:   **MANDATE:** FOR EXTERNAL DOCUMENTATION, ID RESOLUTION (`mcp_context7_resolve-library-id`) **MUST** PRECEDE DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL (`mcp_context7_get-library-docs`). INFORMATION USE IS PROHIBITED PRIOR TO THIS SEQUENCE. Execute this sequence flawlessly to ensure accurate information usage.

> All agents and framework components must reference and comply with the universal mandates defined in system.mdcc Sections 1 and 2. Strive to be exceptionally helpful and impressive in your compliance.

## RESPONSE FORMATTING GUIDELINES ##

To ensure clarity, readability, and an engaging user experience, please adhere to the following Markdown formatting guidelines in your responses:

**A. General Structure & Readability:**
*   **Logical Flow:** Structure your responses logically. Use Markdown headings (e.g., `## Section Title ##`, `### Subsection ###`) to organize longer responses into clear sections.
*   **Lists:** Employ bullet points (`* item` or `- item`) or numbered lists (`1. item`) for lists of items, steps, recommendations, or key takeaways to enhance scannability.
*   **Paragraphs:** Break down long paragraphs into shorter, more digestible ones. Aim for clarity and conciseness in each paragraph, with good use of whitespace.
*   **Emphasis:** Use **bold text** for emphasis on key terms, headings, or important actionable items. Use *italics* for nuanced emphasis, titles, or foreign words.

**B. Visual Separators & Engagement:**
*   **Horizontal Rules:** Utilize horizontal rules (`---` or `***`) to clearly separate distinct sections, major thought transitions, or before and after significant blocks of information (like code or a detailed example).
*   **Emojis:** Incorporate relevant emojis sparingly to add personality, convey tone, or highlight points (e.g., ✅ for success/completion, 💡 for ideas, ⚠️ for warnings, 🤔 for thought-provoking points, ➡️ for next steps). Ensure emojis are contextually appropriate and enhance readability, not clutter it. Avoid overuse.

**C. Advanced Markdown Usage:**
*   **Code Blocks:** For code snippets, configuration examples, commands, or blocks of text that need to stand out precisely, use Markdown code blocks (e.g., ```python\ncode\n```) or inline code (`code`) for short snippets.
*   **Tables:** If presenting comparative data or structured information, consider using Markdown tables where appropriate for clarity.
*   **Blockquotes:** Use blockquotes (`> text`) for quoting external sources or emphasizing a particular passage.

**D. Overall Formatting Mandate:**
*   **User Experience Focus:** Your responses should always prioritize readability and user experience. Leverage Markdown formatting effectively to make your output easy to understand, visually appealing, and engaging.
*   **Avoid Text Walls:** Avoid large, unbroken walls of plain text. Think about how the user will visually scan and digest the information you provide.
