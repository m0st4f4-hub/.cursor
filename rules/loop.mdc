# ⚙️ Framework & Core Agent Execution Loop

**Defines:**
1.  **External Agent Execution Framework:** Orchestrates agents (Part 1).
2.  **Mandatory Core Agent Execution Loop:** Internal steps per turn (Part 2).

## PART 1: AGENT EXECUTION FRAMEWORK (External Orchestrator)

**Purpose:** System/process orchestrating agent execution (MCP preferred). **Not an agent.**

**Responsibilities (MUST):**
1.  **Activation & Sequencing:**
    *   Activate agents based on MCP tasks (via `Overmind` polling) or Chat Triggers.
    *   Load agent rules (respecting hierarchy).
    *   Invoke agent, providing context (`taskId` / trigger payload) per **Part 2, Step 1**.
    *   Ensure sequential execution per `requestId`.
2.  **Capability Provision:** Provide authorized capabilities; execute calls; return results.
3.  **Rule Management:** Provide means to fetch rules; manage `.cursor/rules/`; respect hierarchy.
4.  **Lifecycle:** Initiate (`Overmind`); manage flow; detect halt conditions.
5.  **Environment:** Provide runtime; manage resource access via authorized capabilities only.

**Interaction:** Activation, Capability Interface, Transition detection (Chat) / MCP operations (MCP). **MUST NOT** require semantic understanding of tasks/triggers. **MUST** enforce **Part 2** loop.

## PART 2: CORE AGENT EXECUTION LOOP (Mandatory, MCP Focus)

**Purpose:** You **MUST** follow this mandatory sequence of steps each time you are activated for a task turn. This ensures your behavior is consistent, predictable, and auditable. You will primarily use the MCP Task Manager (or Chat, if applicable) as your Single Source of Truth for instructions and status.

**Rules You MUST Follow:**
*   You **MUST** execute Steps 1 through 6 sequentially in every turn. You cannot skip steps, except when a HALT condition is met.
*   You **MUST** treat the coordination mechanism (MCP Task details or Chat Payload) as the definitive source for your task instructions and context.
*   You **MUST** get your full context (Step 2) *before* taking significant action.
*   You **MUST** fetch and use your own role-specific rules (Step 3).
*   When reporting your results (Step 6), you **MUST** include details about your verification actions and any assumptions you made or identified.
*   **If any required MCP tool or capability is unavailable, you MUST NOT halt. Instead, skip that step, log the skipped action/tool in your MCP task update or handoff, and continue with the next logical action.**

**Action Sequence (Your Mandatory Steps):**

**Step 1: Activate & Get Initial Context**
*   **Activation:** The Framework activates you.
*   **Input:** You receive a `taskId` (MCP) or a Trigger Payload (Chat).
*   **Action:** You will store the `taskId` or parse the payload to extract initial context.

**Step 2: Get Full Task/Operational Context**
*   **Action:** You will fetch the detailed instructions and operational context for your task.
*   **Operation (MCP):** You will open task details with your stored `taskId`.
*   **Action (Chat):** You will use the context parsed from the payload in Step 1.
*   **Action (Both):** You **MUST** critically evaluate the context according to the principles in @`system.md`. You will identify your assumptions and verify the feasibility of the task.

**Step 3: Fetch Your Role Specification**
*   **Action:** You will retrieve the rules that define your current role.
*   **Method:** You will fetch your specific agent rule file (e.g., `builder-agent.md`).

**Step 4: Plan Your Turn (Internal)**
*   **Action:** You will internally prepare your plan of action for the current turn.
*   **Input:** Your rules (from Step 3) and the full task context (from Step 2).
*   **Process:** You will construct your internal reasoning or prompt. You will plan the specific operations needed for Step 5, ensuring you include **mandatory verification** steps and checks for any **assumptions** you identified, as required by @`system.md`.

**Step 5: Execute Your Core Task(s) & Verify**
*   **Action:** You will perform the primary function(s) defined by your role and the current task.
*   **Capabilities:** You will use the capabilities authorized for your role.
*   **Input:** Your plan (from Step 4) and the context (from Step 2).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Execute:** You will run the operations you planned.
    2.  **Verify:** You will execute the verification steps you planned. You will analyze the results.
    3.  **Record Internally:** You will consolidate the results of your actions, the outcomes of your verification checks (PASS/FAIL), a record of assumptions addressed, and any remaining uncertainties.

**Step 6: Update State / Construct Handoff & Finalize Your Turn (FINAL ACTION)**
*   **Action:** You will persist the results of your turn to the coordination mechanism and then terminate your execution for this turn.
*   **Operations (MCP):** You will update the task and potentially mark the task done.
*   **Mechanism (Chat):** You will use the Framework's Chat Mechanism.
*   **Input:** Your `taskId` (MCP), your internal results recorded in Step 5.
*   **Process (MCP):**
    1.  **Update Task:** You will update the task, providing a **comprehensive summary** of your findings in the description. This **MUST** include: actions taken, verification methods and results, assumptions made or addressed, remaining uncertainties, and any errors encountered, as per @`system.md` Mandate 10.
    2.  **Mark Done:** If your task is complete according to your rules and verification, you will mark the task done.
    3.  **Terminate:** You **MUST** end your execution turn now.
*   **Process (Chat):**
    1.  **Determine Next Agent:** You will determine the `<NextAgentRole>` based on your rules and the task outcome.
    2.  **Construct Handoff:** You will create a concise payload containing your **comprehensive findings** (as described for MCP above).
    3.  **Trigger:** You will send the Chat Trigger: "Hey `<NextAgentRole>`, [Handoff Payload]".
    4.  **Terminate:** You **MUST** end your execution turn now.

**Error Handling:**
*   **Step 2 Failure (Cannot get context):** You will HALT.
*   **Step 6 Failure (Cannot update state/trigger next):** You may retry the final operation once. If it still fails, you will HALT. Attempt local logging if possible.
*   **Step 5 Errors (During core task):** You **MUST** log a detailed analysis of the error in your Step 6 update/handoff message before either continuing (if recoverable per your rules) or HALTing. You **MUST** ensure errors are clearly reported to `Overmind` via the coordination mechanism.
