# üîÑ Core Execution Loop (MANDATORY)

**PURPOSE:** Defines the mandatory, sequential steps each agent MUST follow during its execution turn within the Chat/Wiki framework. Ensures consistency, traceability, and controlled handoffs, including direct agent-to-agent sub-task delegation.

**CONTEXT:** This loop is initiated when an agent is activated by a **Chat Trigger**. This trigger could originate from `Overmind` (initial task, escalation), or *directly from another agent* (for sub-task delegation or completion). It assumes access to necessary tools.

**PRINCIPLES (MANDATORY):**
- **SEQUENTIAL:** Steps MUST be executed in the specified order (1-8).
- **IDEMPOTENT (where applicable):** Strive for safe repetition.
- **STATEFUL VIA WIKI:** Primary context store. Read Step 2, Update Step 6.
- **ROLE-DRIVEN:** Behavior dictated by Role Spec.
- **NO WAITING (Except Diagnostics):** Proceed autonomously, only pause for diagnostics (Step 5 HALT).
- **FINAL ACTION = TRIGGER:** Turn concludes *only* by generating a Chat Trigger (standard handoff, escalation, sub-task delegation, or sub-task completion) in Step 8.

## WORKFLOW (MANDATORY STEPS 1-8)

### Step 1: Activate via Chat Trigger & Get Context
1.  **RECEIVE TRIGGER:** Agent activated by a Chat Trigger.
2.  **PARSE TRIGGER:** Extract critical info:
    *   `requestId`.
    *   `taskId` (if applicable - could be a primary task or a sub-task).
    *   **Trigger Type:** Determine if it's a standard task activation (likely from `Overmind`), an escalation, a sub-task delegation (from another agent), or a sub-task completion notification (from a sub-agent).
    *   **Calling Agent:** If it's a sub-task delegation or completion, note the `CallingAgentRole`.
3.  **STORE CONTEXT:** Keep parsed info locally for the turn.

### Step 2: Read Knowledge Wiki
1.  **IDENTIFY WIKI:** Use `requestId`.
2.  **READ WIKI:** Use `read_file`. Capture full context, including potential sub-task results if reactivated.
3.  **STORE CONTEXT:** Load into working memory.

### Step 3: Fetch Own Role Specification
1.  **IDENTIFY ROLE:** Agent knows its role.
2.  **FETCH RULES:** Use `fetch_rules`.
3.  **STORE RULES:** Load into working memory.

### Step 4: Construct Role-Prompt & Plan Turn
1.  **SYNTHESIZE CONTEXT:** Combine info from Trigger (Step 1), Wiki (Step 2), Role Spec (Step 3), and potentially MCP Task Details (fetched here if needed).
2.  **ANALYZE & PLAN:** Based on context, role, and **trigger type**, formulate a plan for Step 5.
    *   **If Standard Task/Sub-Task Activation:** Plan execution steps. Decide if decomposition and direct sub-task delegation is needed.
    *   **If Reactivated by Sub-Task Completion:** Plan how to integrate the sub-task results (read from Wiki) and resume the parent task.
    *   **If Decomposition Needed:** Plan creation of sub-tasks (using MCP tools) and identify the first sub-agent to delegate to directly.
    *   Identify tools, sequence actions, consider errors.
3.  *(Self-Correction/Refinement):* Review plan against goals and constraints.

### Step 5: Execute Core Task(s)
1.  **EXECUTE PLAN:** Perform actions using authorized tools.
    *   Standard execution (code edits, research, etc.).
    *   **Creating Sub-Tasks:** Use `mcp_taskmanager_add_tasks_to_request` if decomposition was planned.
    *   **Integrating Sub-Task Results:** Process results logged in Wiki by completed sub-agents.
    *   *(Ensure necessary state is preserved if planning to delegate and await results)*.
2.  **HANDLE TOOL OUTPUTS:** Process and store results for Step 6.
3.  **DIAGNOSTICS (USER INPUT - STRICTLY LIMITED):**
    *   *Condition:* Critical ambiguity or tool error, AND role spec permits.
    *   *Action:* Ask specific question, state HALT.
    *   *Constraint:* MUST NOT proceed until user responds & new turn initiated (likely via `Overmind`). Only permissible pause.

### Step 6: Update Knowledge Wiki
1.  **SYNTHESIZE RESULTS:** Consolidate outcomes, actions, errors, sub-task creations, integrated results, etc.
2.  **FORMAT ENTRY:** Adhere to [Wiki Handling](mdc:wiki-handling.md) format (Timestamp, Role, TaskId, ParentTaskId, CallingAgent if relevant).
3.  **APPEND TO WIKI:** Use `edit_file` under the appropriate section.

### Step 7: Determine Next Agent & Handoff Message
1.  **ASSESS OUTCOME:** Based on Step 5 results, role spec, and trigger type:
    *   **If Task Completed (and was top-level or final sub-task):** Select `Overmind` for standard completion handoff.
    *   **If Task Completed (and was a sub-task with results):** Select the original `CallingAgentRole` (identified in Step 1) to report completion.
    *   **If Sub-Task Delegated:** Select the chosen `SubAgentRole` to delegate to.
    *   **If Error/Escalation:** Select `Overmind`.
    *   **If Decomposition via Overmind (Legacy):** Select `Overmind`.
2.  **FORMULATE HANDOFF MESSAGE:** Craft message based on the scenario:
    *   **Standard Completion:** "Task `<taskId>` complete. Status: [Success/Failure]."
    *   **Sub-Task Delegation:** "Execute sub-task `<sub_taskId>` for parent `<parent_taskId>` (Caller: `<CurrentAgentRole>`). Report results to `<CurrentAgentRole>`."
    *   **Sub-Task Completion:** "Sub-task `<sub_taskId>` (Parent: `<parent_taskId>`) completed. See Wiki section [X] for results."
    *   **Escalation:** "Encountered error [summary] on task `<taskId>`. Escalating."
    *   Include `requestId`.

### Step 8: Generate Next Chat Trigger (FINAL ACTION)
1.  **FORMAT TRIGGER:** Construct message precisely: "Hey `<NextAgentRole>`, [Handoff Message from Step 7]".
2.  **SEND TRIGGER:** Use framework's Chat Mechanism.
3.  **TERMINATE TURN:** Agent's turn concludes immediately. The output MUST end with the Chat Trigger.

---
**FAILURE CONDITION (HALT):** If critical error or diagnostic input needed:
1.  Update Wiki (Step 6) with error details (`## ‚ö†Ô∏è Errors & Escalations`).
2.  Determine `Overmind` as next agent (Step 7).
3.  Generate trigger (Step 8) to `Overmind`, indicating HALT and referencing task/caller if applicable.
4.  Terminate.

## INPUTS & OUTPUTS

*   **Input:** Chat Trigger message (including type, caller), Knowledge Wiki, Role Specification.
*   **Output:** Updated Knowledge Wiki, Final Chat Trigger message for the next agent (or calling agent).

## TOOLS

*   `read_file`
*   `fetch_rules`
*   `edit_file`
*   Agent-specific authorized tools (MCP tools, analysis tools, execution tools)
*   Framework Chat Mechanism

## HANDOFF CONDITIONS

*   Successful completion of Step 8 triggers the next agent (Overmind, SubAgent, or CallingAgent).

## ERROR HANDLING

*   **Wiki/Rule Read Failure:** HALT immediately, trigger `Overmind`.
*   **Tool Failure / Ambiguity (Step 5):** Follow Diagnostics/HALT procedure.
*   **Wiki Append Failure (Step 6):** Retry `edit_file`/`reapply`. If still fails, HALT, trigger `Overmind`.
*   **Sub-Task HALT:** If an agent running a sub-task HALTs, it triggers `Overmind`. `Overmind` needs logic to understand this occurred within a sub-task chain and potentially escalate the *parent* task status.

## CONSTRAINTS & FORBIDDEN PATTERNS

*   MUST follow steps 1-8 sequentially.
*   MUST NOT wait (except Step 5 Diagnostics HALT).
*   MUST use Wiki for state.
*   MUST conclude with Step 8 Trigger.
*   MUST handle different trigger types correctly (standard, sub-task delegation, sub-task completion).
