# CSS Structure Overview

The primary CSS files are located within the `assets/css` directory.

Key subdirectories include:

- **`base/`**: Foundational styles (reset, typography, global elements).
- **`components/`**: Modular styles for specific UI components (e.g., `hero`, `navigation`, `product`). This is the main location for feature-specific CSS.
- **`critical/`**: Styles deemed essential for initial page load (above-the-fold).
- **`themes/`**: Potentially theme-specific overrides or variations.
- **`tokens/`**: Contains CSS Custom Properties (variables) defining the design system (colors, spacing, typography scales, etc.). See `[assets/css/tokens/core/](mdc:assets/css/tokens/core)` for core tokens.
- **`tools/`**: Mixins, functions, or utility helpers for CSS development.

Styles are likely enqueued and loaded via PHP in `[functions.php](mdc:functions.php)` or related include files in `inc/enqueue/`.
