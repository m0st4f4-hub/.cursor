# 🏁 FRAMEWORK INITIALIZATION PROCEDURE

**SPECIFIES:** PROCEDURE FOR INITIALIZING THE AGENT FRAMEWORK (PRIMARILY VIA `SeedingAgent`).

## 1. PURPOSE

TO ESTABLISH THE NECESSARY OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND CORE RULESET FOR THE AUTONOMOUS AGENT FRAMEWORK.

## 2. TRIGGERING MECHANISM

*   **INITIAL SETUP:** EXECUTED ONCE PER NEW WORKSPACE OR PROJECT REQUIRING THE FULL FRAMEWORK.
*   **TRIGGER:** CAN BE MANUAL OR VIA `mcp_project-manager_create_task_tasks__post` ASSIGNED TO `SeedingAgent`.

## 3. PROCEDURE (EXECUTED BY `SeedingAgent`)

1.  **WORKSPACE ROOT CONFIRMATION:** VERIFY CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY IS THE INTENDED PROJECT ROOT.
2.  **RULE DIRECTORY CREATION:** CREATE THE `.cursor/rules/` DIRECTORY IF IT DOES NOT EXIST.
3.  **RULE FILE DEPLOYMENT:**
    *   FOR EACH CORE RULE FILE LISTED IN `entrypoint.mdc` (EXCLUDING `init.mdc` ITSELF AND `entrypoint.mdc` IF BEING USED AS THE SOURCE LIST):
        *   FETCH THE MASTER COPY OF THE RULE (E.G., FROM A CENTRAL REPOSITORY OR EMBEDDED DATA).
        *   WRITE/COPY THE RULE FILE INTO `.cursor/rules/`.
        *   EXAMPLE: `system.mdcc` FROM MASTER SOURCE TO `.cursor/rules/system.mdcc`.
    *   DEPLOY AGENT-SPECIFIC RULES (`agents/*.mdcc`) SIMILARLY.
4.  **MCP TASK UPDATE:** `SeedingAgent` **MUST** UPDATE ITS MCP TASK STATUS TO "COMPLETED_AWAITING_PROJECTMANAGER" UPON SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT.

## 4. CORE RULESET

THE MINIMUM CORE RULESET TO BE DEPLOYED INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, THE FILES REFERENCED IN `entrypoint.mdc`. THE `SeedingAgent`'S OWN RULE FILE (`agents/seeding.mdc`) CONTAINS THE MOST UP-TO-DATE LIST OF FILES IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SEEDING.

> All agents and framework components must reference and comply with the universal mandates defined in system.mdc Sections 1 and 2.
