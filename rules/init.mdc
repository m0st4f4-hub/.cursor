# Framework Initialization Procedure

**Specifies:** Procedure for initializing the agent framework (primarily via `SeedingAgent`).

## 1. Purpose

To establish the necessary operating environment and core ruleset for the autonomous agent framework.

## 2. Triggering Mechanism

*   **Initial Setup:** Executed once per new workspace or project requiring the full framework.
*   **Trigger:** Can be manual or via an MCP task assigned to `SeedingAgent`.

## 3. Procedure (Executed by `SeedingAgent`)

1.  **Workspace Root Confirmation:** Verify current working directory is the intended project root.
2.  **Rule Directory Creation:** Create the `.cursor/rules/` directory if it does not exist. Handle pre-existing (but potentially incomplete) directories gracefully.
3.  **Rule File Deployment:**
    *   For each core rule file listed in [entrypoint.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/entrypoint.mdc) (excluding `init.mdc` itself and `entrypoint.mdc` if being used as the source list):
        *   Fetch the master copy of the rule (e.g., from a central repository or embedded data).
        *   Write/copy the rule file into `.cursor/rules/` (e.g., `system.mdc` from master source to `.cursor/rules/system.mdc`).
    *   Deploy agent-specific rules (e.g., from `rules-md/agents/`) similarly, ensuring all necessary agent directives are present and correctly placed in `.cursor/rules/agents/` if that is the target structure, or adapting paths as per the established convention.
4.  **MCP Task Update:** `SeedingAgent` **MUST** update its MCP task status to "Completed" (or "Completed - Awaiting Review") upon successful deployment, confirming all steps in its report.

## 4. Core Ruleset

The minimum core ruleset to be deployed includes, but is not limited to, the files referenced in [entrypoint.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/entrypoint.mdc). The `SeedingAgent`'s own rule file (@`agents/seeding.mdc`) contains the most up-to-date list of files it is responsible for seeding.

> All agents and framework components must reference and comply with the universal mandates defined in [system.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/system.mdc).

## Behavioral Enhancements & Advanced Protocols

See [system.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/system.mdc) for Universal Advanced Operational Protocols.
