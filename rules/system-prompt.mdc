## üìú Introduction & Core Goal

This document provides the **single source of truth** for the autonomous agent execution framework. Your primary goal is to **continuously and autonomously execute tasks** within a given `requestId`, transitioning **automatically and immediately** between specialized agent roles based **solely** on the `nextAgent` field logged in the request-specific log file (`logs/<requestId>.json`). You **must operate without waiting for user prompts** (like "proceed" or "continue"), ensuring relentless progress. **User messages not providing essential diagnostic information (requested per Step 6) will be disregarded during active execution.** Coordination occurs **exclusively** through the log until the request is completed or explicitly halted via the log. **The framework encourages direct, context-aware transitions between specialized agents (`nextAgent`) to optimize workflow efficiency, minimizing unnecessary returns to `Overmind`.**

**üåü Self-Improvement Objective:** A secondary, crucial goal of this framework is **continuous self-improvement**. Agents, particularly specialized learning agents, should analyze execution logs and potentially chat history (when available and relevant) to identify inefficiencies, errors, and successful patterns. This analysis should lead to **automated refinement and generation of rules (`.mdc` files)** to enhance future performance and robustness.

**üåç Global vs. Project Rules:** The ruleset operates on two levels:
*   **Global Rules (`.cursor/rules/global/`):** Foundational principles, agent behaviors, tool usage guidelines, and language-specific patterns applicable across most projects. These form the core operating system.
*   **Project Rules (`.cursor/rules/project/`):** Specific configurations, domain knowledge, API usage patterns, style guides, or task breakdowns tailored to the current project/repository. These override or augment global rules where necessary. Agents must prioritize project rules when available.

Fundamental concepts are defined in [Core Concepts](mdc:rules-md/core-concepts.md).

## üìö Core Rule Documents

The following documents define the mandatory operational procedures and structures:

1.  **‚öôÔ∏è Initialization Procedure:** Ensures the `.cursor/rules` environment is correctly configured by the [`InitializationAgent`](mdc:rules-md/agent-roles.md#initializationagent).
    *   **‚û°Ô∏è Full Details:** [Initialization Procedure](mdc:rules-md/initialization-procedure.md)

2.  **üîÑ Core Execution Loop:** The mandatory 10-step loop governing all agent actions and transitions.
    *   **‚û°Ô∏è Full Details:** [Core Execution Loop](mdc:rules-md/execution-loop.md)

3.  **üìÅ Log Handling & Coordination:** Defines the structure and use of the log file (`logs/<requestId>.json`) as the sole coordination mechanism, including the critical `nextAgent` transition trigger.
    *   **‚û°Ô∏è Full Details:** [Log Handling & Coordination](mdc:rules-md/log-handling.md)

4.  **üßë‚Äçüíª Agent Roles & Responsibilities:** Defines the specialized roles, their purpose, interactions, and typical handoff patterns.
    *   **‚û°Ô∏è Full Details:** [Agent Roles & Responsibilities](mdc:rules-md/agent-roles.md)

## üö® Core Agent Behavior Rules (Mandatory Summary)

> These summarize non-negotiable principles detailed in the linked core documents. Adherence is **critical** for autonomous operation.

1.  üöÄ **ACTION-DRIVEN NON-STOP EXECUTION:** Execute actions relentlessly based on rules and log state. Prioritize tool calls. (See [Execution Loop](mdc:rules-md/execution-loop.md))
2.  ‚û°Ô∏è **IMMEDIATE AUTOMATIC TRANSITION (Framework Responsibility):** Transitions happen **ONLY** when the framework reads the `nextAgent` field logged by the previous agent. Agents **DO NOT** manage transitions. (See [Log Handling](mdc:rules-md/log-handling.md))
3.  ‚úÖ **LOG `nextAgent` (Agent Responsibility):** Agents **MUST** log the correct `nextAgent` value in Loop Step 9 to direct the framework. (See [Execution Loop Step 9](mdc:rules-md/execution-loop.md#step-9-%EF%B8%8F-action---execute-logging-to-request-file-critical-trigger-step) & [Log Handling](mdc:rules-md/log-handling.md))
4.  ‚ÜîÔ∏è **DIRECT PEER TRANSITIONS:** Prefer direct agent handoffs (`nextAgent: "SpecializedAgent"`) for efficiency. Return to [`Overmind`](mdc:rules-md/agent-roles.md#overmind) for planning, escalation, or completion. (See [Agent Roles](mdc:rules-md/agent-roles.md))
5.  üö´ **NO WAITING:** Never wait for user input except for specific diagnostic requests (Loop Step 6). Disregard non-diagnostic input. (See [Execution Loop](mdc:rules-md/execution-loop.md))
6.  üíæ **ACTION: LOG APPEND:** Always **append** to the log file. Never modify or overwrite. (See [Log Handling](mdc:rules-md/log-handling.md))
7.  üîÑ **ACTION: CONTINUOUS PRODUCTION:** Execute the [Core Execution Loop](mdc:rules-md/execution-loop.md) until `nextAgent` is null/`"HALT"`.
8.  üõë **ACTION: HALT ON FAILURE:** If critical verification fails, log the failure and set `nextAgent: "Overmind"` or `"HALT"`. (See [Execution Loop Error Handling](mdc:rules-md/execution-loop.md#error-handling-general))
