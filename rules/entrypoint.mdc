# ðŸ§­ Framework Entrypoint & Core Document Index

## 1. PURPOSE

This document serves as a central reference point, providing links to the essential rule files that define the structure, operation, and core principles of the autonomous agent framework.

## 2. FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

The framework operates based on specialized agents coordinated primarily via the MCP Task Manager (with Chat Triggers as a secondary mechanism). Agents execute tasks sequentially according to the mandatory [Framework & Execution Loop](mdc:framework-execution-loop.mdc), adhering strictly to their defined roles ([Agent Roles & Responsibilities](mdc:agent-roles.md)) and the non-negotiable [System Prompt & Mandates](mdc:system-prompt-and-mandates.mdc).

The core philosophy emphasizes rigor, verification, critical scrutiny, assumption awareness, and detailed reporting, derived from the [Ultra-Deep Thinking Protocol](./ultra-deep-thinking-protocol.md) which is fully executed by `Overmind`.

## 3. CORE FRAMEWORK RULE DOCUMENTS

*   **System Overview & Global Rules:**
    *   [System Prompt & Mandates](mdc:system-prompt-and-mandates.mdc)
      *   *Defines overall goals, operational model, and non-negotiable rules for all agents.* 
*   **Framework Engine & Agent Turn Process:**
    *   [Framework & Execution Loop](mdc:framework-execution-loop.mdc)
      *   *Defines the external execution engine and the mandatory steps each agent follows per turn.*
*   **Core Concepts & Terms:**
    *   [Core Concepts & Definitions](mdc:core-concepts-and-definitions.mdc)
      *   *Provides a glossary of key terms, entities, and mechanisms.*

## 4. KEY SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS & PROCEDURES

*   **Agent Role Definitions:**
    *   [Agent Roles & Responsibilities](mdc:agent-roles.md)
      *   *Central registry summarizing all defined agent roles.*
    *   Individual Agent Files (`rules-md/agents/*.md`)
      *   *Detailed specifications for each agent role.*
*   **Core Protocols & Procedures:**
    *   [Ultra-Deep Thinking Protocol](./ultra-deep-thinking-protocol.md) (Executed by Overmind)
      *   *Detailed methodology for rigorous planning, verification, and analysis.*
    *   [Initialization Procedure](mdc:initialization-procedure.md) (Executed by InitializationAgent)
      *   *Mandatory procedure for setting up the `.cursor/rules/` directory.*

## 5. USAGE NOTES

*   Agents fetch their *own* role specification (`fetch_rules <agent_role>.md`).
*   Adherence to [System Prompt & Mandates](mdc:system-prompt-and-mandates.mdc) and the [Framework & Execution Loop](mdc:framework-execution-loop.mdc) is mandatory and implicit in the framework's operation.
*   This document serves primarily as a human-readable index and high-level map of the core rules.
