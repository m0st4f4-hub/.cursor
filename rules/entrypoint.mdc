# ðŸ§­ Framework Entrypoint & Core Rule Index

**Purpose:** Use this central index to find the essential rule documents that define how this system operates.

## 1. CORE FRAMEWORK RULES

*   **System Overview & Global Rules:** @`system.md`
    *   *Defines overall goals, operational model, non-negotiable rules.*
*   **Framework Engine & Agent Turn Process:** @`loop.md`
    *   *Defines external engine and mandatory agent turn steps.*
*   **Core Concepts & Terms:** @`concepts.md`
    *   *Glossary of key terms, entities, mechanisms.*
*   **Ultra-Deep Thinking Protocol:** @`protocol.md` (Executed by Overmind)
    *   *Methodology for rigorous planning, verification, analysis.*
*   **Initialization Procedure:** @`init.md` (Executed by InitializationAgent)
    *   *Mandatory setup procedure for `.cursor/rules/`.*

## 2. AGENT & TOOL RULES

*   **Agent Role Definitions:**
    *   **Registry:** @`roles.md`
    *   **Specifications:** Located in `@agents/` directory. *Primary source for agent rules.*

## 3. USAGE NOTES

*   As an agent, you **MUST** fetch your own role specification at the start of your turn.
*   Your adherence to @`system.md` (Global Mandates) and @`loop.md` (Core Execution Loop) is mandatory unless explicitly overridden by your specific role file.
*   If any required MCP tool or capability is unavailable, you MUST NOT halt. Instead, skip that step, log the skipped action/tool in your MCP task update or handoff, and continue with the next logical action.
*   You can use this document as a primary index to find other core rule documents when needed.
*   This document is the primary human-readable index.

## MCP Tool Reference (See system.md for full details)

The following MCP tools are available and should be used by all agents for context, execution, verification, and reporting:

- `mcp_project-manager_get_task_by_id_tasks__task_id__get`: Fetch task context
- `mcp_project-manager_update_task_tasks__task_id__put`: Update task status
- `mcp_project-manager_create_task_tasks__post`: Create new tasks
- `mcp_project-manager_get_project_list_projects__get`: List projects
- `mcp_project-manager_create_project_projects__post`: Create projects
- `mcp_project-manager_get_agent_list_agents__get`: List agents
- `mcp_project-manager_create_agent_agents__post`: Register agents
- `mcp_project-manager_delete_task_tasks__task_id__delete`: Delete tasks
- `mcp_project-manager_delete_agent_agents__agent_id__delete`: Delete agents
- `mcp_desktop-commander_execute_command`: Run shell/OS commands
- `mcp_desktop-commander_list_directory`: List files/directories
- `mcp_desktop-commander_read_file`: Read file contents
- `mcp_desktop-commander_search_code`: Search code/files
- `mcp_desktop-commander_edit_block`: Edit files
- `mcp_desktop-commander_move_file`, `mcp_desktop-commander_create_directory`, `mcp_desktop-commander_write_file`, `mcp_desktop-commander_delete_file`: File/directory management

**Mandate:** Agents MUST use as many relevant MCP tools as possible for each step, and use multiple tools for verification of critical actions. See system.md for full details and requirements.
