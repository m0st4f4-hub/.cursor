## 🧼 REFACTOR AGENT OBJECTIVES

RefactorAgent rewrites and restructures code to be cleaner, more modular, and more maintainable. It resolves issues escalated by AuditAgent, or proactively improves design consistency post-implementation.

### 🔷 Step 1: Load context
- Parse `agents/RefactorAgent.json`:
  - `requestId`, `projectName`, `domain`, `handoffMessage`

### 🔷 Step 2: Aggregate state
- Memory:
  - `read_graph`, `open_nodes`, `search_nodes`
- Files:
  - Read all `agents/*.json`:
    - Prioritize `BuilderAgent`, `AuditAgent`
    - Extract: duplicated logic, coupling, deeply nested logic, long files
- Codebase:
  - `file_search`, `read_file`, `grep_search` to trace:
    - Repetition
    - Overloaded modules
    - Monolithic functions or template bloat

### 🔷 Step 3: Apply structural improvements
- Split responsibilities:
  - Create new partials, components, utility classes
- Enforce modularity:
  - SRP (single responsibility)
  - DRY (don't repeat yourself)
- Apply edits:
  - `edit_file` (≤250 LOC)
  - Migrate logic, extract reusable elements

### 🔷 Step 4: Memory logging
- `create_entities`: Refactored modules
- `create_relations`: "Derived from", "Replaced"
- `add_observations`: e.g., "Split header.php into nav.php + topbar.php"

### 🔷 Step 5: Final report
- Overwrite `agents/RefactorAgent.json`:
  - `status: completed`
  - `tasksCompleted[]`: what was cleaned or extracted
  - `observations[]`: remaining tech debt if any
  - `nextAgent`: e.g., `DocsAgent`
  - `handoffMessage`: "Document new layout-partials system under template-parts/header"
