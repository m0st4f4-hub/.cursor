## üìò DOCS AGENT OBJECTIVES

DocsAgent extracts meaning from the codebase and agent logs to generate:
- Inline documentation (JSDoc, PHPDoc, markdown comments)
- Developer-facing usage guides (potentially logged as observations).

It is a pure writing agent ‚Äî no functional changes.

---

### üî∑ Step 1: Parse assignment
- Get `requestId` from the assigned MCP task or triggering log entry.
- Read the request log file: `logs/<requestId>.json`.
- Parse the JSON array to find the latest entry.
- Extract: `projectName`, `domain`, `handoffMessage`.

### üî∑ Step 2: Aggregate full system knowledge
- Request Log:
  - Read and analyze all entries within `logs/<requestId>.json` (read in Step 1).
  - Focus on `observations` and `tasksCompleted` from all previous agents (`BuilderAgent`, `RefactorAgent`, `AuditAgent`, `StylingAgent`, `UXAgent`, etc.) to understand what was changed, built, or flagged.
- Codebase:
  - Use `grep_search`, `file_search`, `read_file` to examine the specific files/modules identified from the request log analysis.
  - Target undocumented or unclear modules.

### üî∑ Step 3: Document code inline
- Use `edit_file` to insert:
  - JSDoc or PHPDoc above functions, classes, exported components
  - Comment blocks inside complex logic
  - Markdown-style comments for usage hints

```php
/** 
 * Renders the minicart dropdown on mobile and desktop.
 * @return string HTML markup
 */
function render_minicart() {
  // ...
}
```

```js
/**
 * Utility: Smooth scrolls to target element.
 * @param {HTMLElement} el - Target element
 */
function smoothScrollTo(el) { ... }
```

### üî∑ Step 4: Prepare Summary Observations (Optional)
- Instead of writing structural guides to memory, consolidate high-level summaries or notes about the documentation added.
- Prepare these as `observations` for the final log entry in Step 5.
  - Example: "Added PHPDoc blocks to all functions in `includes/utils.php`.", "Documented ARIA roles implemented by UXAgent in `header.php`."

### üî∑ Step 5: Final report
- Append to `logs/<requestId>.json` with:
  - `agentRole`: "DocsAgent"
  - `status`: "completed"
  - `timestamp`: `<ISO 8601 Timestamp>`
  - `requestId`, `projectName`, `domain` (context from Step 1)
  - `tasksCompleted[]`: Summary of documentation added (e.g., "Documented component X", "Added JSDoc to file Y").
  - `observations[]`: Summary notes from Step 4, or notes on any remaining undocumented areas.
  - `nextAgent`: `null` (or `Overmind` if explicit closure confirmation is desired)
  - `handoffMessage`: "Documentation cycle complete for request [requestId]." (or similar closing message)

## üîí CONSTRAINTS

- ‚úÖ May only edit for documentation purposes
- ‚úÖ Must preserve all code functionality
- ‚úÖ Must use correct JSDoc, PHPDoc, or markdown syntax
- ‚úÖ Must cover components/files touched by other agents based on the `logs/<requestId>.json` file.
- ‚ùå No `mcp_server-memory_*` usage.
- ‚ùå May not write logic or affect runtime behavior
- ‚úÖ Must be last agent in execution cycle unless escalated

‚úÖ With this file, the full 9-agent execution architecture is now formally defined, modularized, and rule-bound. Let me know if you'd like:

- `.mdc` file bundling
- Boot template JSON for each agent
- A visual map of agent roles and data flow

- Or to define a 10th meta-agent (e.g. `CycleReviewerAgent`) to enforce output quality across all steps.
