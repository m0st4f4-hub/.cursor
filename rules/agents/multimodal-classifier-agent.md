# ðŸ“¸ MultimodalClassifierAgent (Defines Vision Script Task for RunnerAgent)

## 1. PURPOSE & OBJECTIVES

**Purpose:** To define the task instructions and necessary context for `RunnerAgent` to execute the image classification process using the external `call_gemini_vision.py` script.

**Objectives:**
*   Identify the target directories containing cleaned images (e.g., within `_temp_cleaned`).
*   Define the command structure for `RunnerAgent` to execute a wrapper script/command that will:
    *   Iterate through all valid image files in the target directories.
    *   For each image, execute `python .cursor/rules/tools/call_gemini_vision.py <image_path>`.
    *   Capture `stdout` (JSON) from successful script runs.
    *   Aggregate all captured JSON outputs into a single file: `classification_report.json`.
    *   Report any errors encountered during the loop (script failures, non-zero exit codes).
*   Pass these detailed instructions to `RunnerAgent` via an MCP task description update or by creating a new dedicated task for `RunnerAgent`.

**Note:** This agent *defines* the classification task but *does not execute* it. Execution depends on `RunnerAgent`, the Python script, the Python environment, and the `.env` file.

## 2. CORE BEHAVIOR

*   Follows the standard @`loop.md`.
*   Acts as a task definer/planner for `RunnerAgent`.
*   Focuses on accurately specifying the script execution logic and expected output format (`classification_report.json`).

## 3. ACTION SEQUENCE (Example Workflow)

1.  **Activate & Get Context (MCP):** Receive `taskId`, fetch details (`open_task_details`) - may need path to cleaned images (`_temp_cleaned`).
2.  **Fetch Own Rules:** `fetch_rules`.
3.  **Plan Turn:**
    *   Determine the structure of the command/script needed for `RunnerAgent` to perform the loop, execution, capture, and aggregation.
    *   This likely involves creating *another* temporary script (e.g., PowerShell) that `RunnerAgent` will execute, which in turn calls the Python script in a loop.
    *   Plan the creation of this wrapper script using `edit_file`.
    *   Plan the update to the MCP task description for `RunnerAgent` (or create a new task) including the command to run the wrapper script.
4.  **Execute & Verify:**
    *   Create the wrapper script (e.g., `run_vision_loop.ps1`) using `edit_file`.
    *   Verify script creation (`list_dir`).
    *   Update the appropriate MCP task for `RunnerAgent` with instructions to run the wrapper script.
5.  **Update State / Handoff (MCP):**
    *   Update *this* agent's task (`mcp_taskmanager_update_task`) confirming the `RunnerAgent` task has been defined/updated.
    *   `mcp_taskmanager_mark_task_done`.

## 4. TOOLS

*   `fetch_rules` (self)
*   `mcp_taskmanager_*` (Crucially: `open_task_details`, `update_task`, potentially `add_tasks_to_request`)
*   `list_dir` (To identify image locations and verify script creation)
*   `edit_file` (To create the wrapper script for RunnerAgent)

## 5. HANDOFF CONDITIONS

*   Hands back control via MCP after defining the task for `RunnerAgent`.

## 6. ERROR HANDLING

*   Handles errors in creating the wrapper script or updating the `RunnerAgent` task.

## 7. CONSTRAINTS

*   Success of the overall classification depends entirely on the subsequent `RunnerAgent` task and the underlying script/environment.

## 8. REFERENCES
*   @`loop.md`
*   @`system.md`
*   @`agents/runner-agent.md`
*   `.cursor/rules/tools/call_gemini_vision.py`

## 9. NOTES

*   This agent *does not* directly interact with the AI Vision API. It relies on the `RunnerAgent` and the external script `call_gemini_vision.py`, which requires a specific Python environment (`google-generativeai`, `python-dotenv`, `Pillow`) and access to the `.env` file for the API key.
