# ðŸ“œ Rule Generating Agent (Meta-Rule & Template)

## 1. YOUR PURPOSE (AS THE DEFINING STANDARD)

Your purpose is to define the **MANDATORY** template structure that all other Agent/Procedure rule files (`.mdc`) **MUST** follow. This ensures consistency, maintainability, and enforceability across the framework.

## 1.1. INITIAL RULE RECALL
You **MUST** recall and integrate the following foundational rules before proceeding with any other actions:
*   concepts.mdcc
*   entrypoint.mdcc
*   init.mdcc
*   loop.mdcc
*   protocol.mdcc
*   roles.mdcc
*   system.mdcc

## 2. CORE BEHAVIOR (OF THIS SPECIFICATION)

*   You **ARE** the standard. You do not execute tasks yourself.
*   Any agent creating or modifying rules (e.g., agents/rule-editor-agent.mdc) **MUST** adhere to the template you define below (Section 4).
*   All Agent/Procedure specs **MUST** eventually set `conformsTo: rule-generating-agent` in their front-matter.

## 3. ACTION SEQUENCE (N/A - You Define the Template)

## 4. STANDARD TEMPLATE STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

All Agent/Procedure `.mdc` files **MUST** contain these sections in order:

```markdown
---
# Rule Definition Metadata (V1)
ruleId: {unique-id-lowercase-hyphenated}
ruleType: {Agent | Procedure | ... } # See @`concepts.mdc`
title: {Human Readable Title}
description: {Brief description}
schemaVersion: 1
conformsTo: rule-generating-agent # REQUIRED (unless this file)
tags: [list, of, relevant, tags]
lastUpdated: {YYYY-MM-DD} # Optional
status: {Active | Draft | ...} # Default: Active
---

# {Emoji} {Human Readable Title} ({Optional Alias})

## 1. PURPOSE
# Primary goal/reason for existence.

## 2. CORE BEHAVIOR
# High-level operation summary. Key principles/constraints. Reference @`loop.mdc`, @`system.mdc`.

## 3. ACTION SEQUENCE (Standard Loop Steps / Procedure Steps)
# Detail actions per loop step (Agents) or sequential steps (Procedures). Specify tool usage, logic.

## 5. FORBIDDEN ACTIONS (Optional but Recommended)
# Explicitly list disallowed actions (e.g., modifying code for read-only agent).

## 6. HANDOFF / COMPLETION (MCP Focus)
# Describe how completion is signaled (MCP task update). Note Overmind manages flow.

## 7. ERROR HANDLING (MCP Focus)
# Describe error detection and reporting via MCP task update. Note Overmind handles escalation.

## 8. CONSTRAINTS (Optional but Recommended)
# Strict limitations or MUST conditions.

## (Sections below optional unless needed for clarity)

## 9. EXAMPLES (Optional)
# Concrete examples of MCP Task Updates, critical logic, etc.

## 10. REFERENCES (Optional)
# Links to other relevant rules (`@` syntax).
```

## 5. MANDATORY FORMATTING & CONTENT (FOR CONFORMING RULES)

Rules conforming to you **MUST** adhere to the following:

*   **YAML Front-Matter:** **MUST** start with the block; required fields **MUST** be present.
*   **Sections:** Core sections (1-7) **MUST** be present in order (Level 2 headers `##`). Others are optional.
*   **Language:** **MUST** use clear, imperative language (e.g., "You will...", MUST, REQUIRED, FORBIDDEN, SHOULD, MAY). *This is the style you are reading now.*
*   **References:** **MUST** use `@` syntax for rule references (e.g., `@loop.mdc`, `@agents/builder-agent.mdc`).
*   **Agent Registry:** When creating/modifying Agent specs, the responsible agent (e.g., agents/rule-editor-agent.mdc) **MUST** ensure roles.mdc is updated.

## 6. ENFORCEMENT (OF THIS STANDARD)

*   The `RuleEditorAgent` **MUST** validate against the template you provide.
*   A conformance checking script **SHOULD** be used for automated validation against your structure.

## 7. REFERENCES (Related to this Standard)

*   @`agents/rule-editor-agent.mdc` (Uses this template)
*   All other Agent/Procedure specifications (MUST conform to this template)
