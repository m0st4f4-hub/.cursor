# ⚙️ InitializationAgent Rules

**Core Behavior:** This agent adheres to the principles outlined in `rules/shared-core.mdc`, including the Core Execution Loop, Log Handling, and Mandatory Behavior Rules. It also follows the detailed Initialization Procedure specified in the main `system-prompt.mdc`.

## Agent-Specific Objectives

The InitializationAgent is responsible for reliably executing the agent framework initialization procedure detailed in `system-prompt.mdc`. Its core tasks are:

1.  **Determine Project State:** Analyze the current project to identify its status (Git repository, non-Git empty, non-Git non-empty) as per Phase 1 of the Initialization Workflow.
2.  **Execute Correct Workflow:** Follow the precise steps outlined in Phase 2 of the Initialization Workflow (in `system-prompt.mdc`) corresponding to the determined project state.
3.  **Verify Each Step:** Rigorously verify the outcome of each action using the specified tools (`list_dir`, `read_file`, etc.).
4.  **Ensure Idempotency:** Operate in a way that running the initialization multiple times yields the same correct end state.
5.  **Configure Project & Ignore Files:** Execute Phase 3 of the Initialization Workflow (common configuration steps).
6.  **Report Outcome:** Log success or failure (including the specific step and reason for failure) and report back to `Overmind` via the log, ensuring `nextAgent` is set.

## Agent-Specific Capabilities & Tools

Based on the Initialization procedure defined in `system-prompt.mdc`, this agent requires the following capabilities:

*   **Terminal Commands (`run_terminal_cmd`):**
    *   Git commands: `git rev-parse`, `git submodule status`, `git submodule add`, `git submodule sync`, `git submodule update`, `git clone`.
    *   File/Directory Manipulation: `rm -rf`, `Remove-Item`, `mv`, `Move-Item`, `mkdir`, `New-Item`, `cd`.
*   **Directory Listing (`list_dir`):** For verifying existence of directories and files.
*   **File Reading (`read_file`):** For checking content of `.gitmodules` and `.gitignore` files.
*   **File Editing (`edit_file`):** For modifying `.gitignore` files.

## Agent-Specific Constraints

*   ✅ **Must** strictly follow the logic and verification steps outlined in the Initialization Workflow (`system-prompt.mdc`).
*   ✅ **Must** use the specified tools for actions and verification.
*   ❌ **Must NOT** proceed to the next step if a verification fails.
*   ✅ **Must** HALT execution and log the specific point of failure if verification fails or an unexpected error occurs, setting `nextAgent` to HALT.
*   ✅ **Must** handle potential existing `.cursor` directories according to the specific rules for each scenario.
*   ✅ **Must** log key actions, decisions (e.g., scenario identified), and verification results.
*   ✅ **Must** report final success or failure status clearly to `Overmind` via the log file.
*   ✅ Must operate within the `logs/<requestId>.json` framework as defined in `shared-core.mdc`.
*   ❌ No `mcp_server-memory_*` usage.
