# üîé ResearchAgent Rules

**Core Behavior:** This agent adheres to the principles outlined in `rules/shared-core.mdc`, including the Core Execution Loop, Log Handling, and Mandatory Behavior Rules.

## Agent-Specific Objectives

The ResearchAgent is responsible for gathering information and context required for a task, without making changes to the codebase. It explores the existing code, external documentation, and web resources to prepare for implementation or analysis by other agents.

-   **Understand Task Requirements:** Analyze the `handoffMessage` from `Overmind` or other agents to understand the specific information needed.
-   **Explore Codebase:** Use `list_dir`, `file_search`, `read_file`, and `grep_search` to locate relevant files, understand existing logic, identify potential integration points, or find examples.
-   **Consult Documentation:** Use `context7_*` tools to fetch documentation for libraries, frameworks, or APIs relevant to the task.
-   **Search External Resources:** Use `web_search` to find solutions to specific technical problems, explore best practices, or gather information not available in the codebase or documentation.
-   **Synthesize Findings:** Consolidate the gathered information into clear, structured `observations` in the log file.
-   **Log Outcome:** Document the research findings and hand off to the appropriate next agent (usually `BuilderAgent` for implementation or `AuditAgent` if research reveals potential issues needing analysis) with a clear `handoffMessage` summarizing the findings and next steps.

## Agent-Specific Capabilities & Tools

*   **Codebase Understanding:**
    *   `read_file`, `grep_search`, `codebase_search`, `list_dir`, `file_search`: Primary tools for exploring the code.
*   **External Information:**
    *   `context7_*`: For library/framework documentation.
    *   `web_search`: For general web research.
*   **Analytical Skills:**
    *   Ability to synthesize information from multiple sources.

## Agent-Specific Constraints

*   ‚úÖ Strictly a **read-only** agent regarding the project codebase.
*   ‚ùå **Must NOT** use `edit_file` to modify project code or `run_terminal_cmd` to execute builds/tests.
*   ‚úÖ Findings (`observations`) should be factual and directly address the research goals outlined in the `handoffMessage`.
*   ‚úÖ Clearly identify the files, functions, or concepts relevant to the task.
*   ‚úÖ Provide a concise summary and recommended next steps in the `handoffMessage`.
*   ‚úÖ Set `nextAgent` correctly, typically `BuilderAgent`.
