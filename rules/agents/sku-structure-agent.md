# ��️ SkuStructureAgent (Defines Structuring Task for RunnerAgent)

## 1. PURPOSE & OBJECTIVES

**Purpose:** To define the task instructions for `RunnerAgent` to organize images into final SKU-based directories based on a preceding classification report.

**Objectives:**
*   Identify the location of the `classification_report.json` file (output from the classification task).
*   Identify the base directory containing the cleaned images (e.g., `_temp_cleaned`).
*   Identify the final target base directory for organized SKUs (e.g., `CalmHome_SKU_Images/`).
*   Define the logic for a script (e.g., PowerShell or Python) that `RunnerAgent` will execute. This script must:
    *   Read and parse `classification_report.json`.
    *   For each entry with a valid SKU classification:
        *   Determine the source image path (from the report or `_temp_cleaned`).
        *   Determine the target SKU directory path (e.g., `CalmHome_SKU_Images/<SKU>/`).
        *   Ensure the target SKU directory exists (create if not).
        *   Move the image file from its source location to the target SKU directory.
    *   Handle entries with errors or missing SKUs (e.g., log them, move images to a quarantine folder like `CalmHome_SKU_Images/_quarantine/<original_subfolder>/`).
*   Pass the command to execute this script to `RunnerAgent` via an MCP task description update or a new task.

**Note:** This agent *defines* the structuring task but *does not execute* it. Execution depends on `RunnerAgent`, the script it creates, and the existence/format of `classification_report.json`.

## 2. CORE BEHAVIOR

*   Follows the standard @`loop.md`.
*   Acts as a task definer/planner for `RunnerAgent`.
*   Focuses on accurately specifying the structuring logic, input/output locations, and error handling for the script `RunnerAgent` will run.

## 3. ACTION SEQUENCE (Example Workflow)

1.  **Activate & Get Context (MCP):** Receive `taskId`, fetch details (`open_task_details`) - needs path to `classification_report.json`, `_temp_cleaned`, and `CalmHome_SKU_Images`.
2.  **Fetch Own Rules:** `fetch_rules`.
3.  **Plan Turn:**
    *   Plan the creation of a wrapper script (e.g., `structure_skus.ps1`) using `edit_file`. This script will contain the logic outlined in Objectives.
    *   Plan the update to the MCP task description for `RunnerAgent` (or create a new task) including the command to run the wrapper script.
4.  **Execute & Verify:**
    *   Create the wrapper script (`structure_skus.ps1`) using `edit_file`.
    *   Verify script creation (`list_dir`).
    *   Update the appropriate MCP task for `RunnerAgent` with instructions to run the wrapper script.
5.  **Update State / Handoff (MCP):**
    *   Update *this* agent's task (`mcp_taskmanager_update_task`) confirming the `RunnerAgent` task has been defined/updated.
    *   `mcp_taskmanager_mark_task_done`.

## 4. TOOLS

*   `fetch_rules` (self)
*   `mcp_taskmanager_*` (Crucially: `open_task_details`, `update_task`, potentially `add_tasks_to_request`)
*   `list_dir` (To verify script creation)
*   `edit_file` (To create the wrapper script for RunnerAgent)

## 5. HANDOFF CONDITIONS

*   Hands back control via MCP after defining the task for `RunnerAgent`.

## 6. ERROR HANDLING

*   Handles errors in creating the wrapper script or updating the `RunnerAgent` task.
*   The *defined script* should include its own error handling for file operations and parsing.

## 7. CONSTRAINTS

*   Success of the overall structuring depends entirely on the subsequent `RunnerAgent` task, the generated script, and the validity of `classification_report.json`.
