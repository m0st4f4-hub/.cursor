# `scaffold_agent.py` Tool Definition

## Purpose
Generates a boilerplate `.mdc` rule file for a new agent within the standard agent directory (`.cursor/rules/agents/`). The generated file includes standard sections with TODO placeholders.

## Arguments
- **`agent_name` (Positional):** The desired name for the new agent in `PascalCase` and ending with `Agent` (e.g., `MyCoolAgent`). This is provided as a command-line argument.

## Output
- Creates a new agent rule file named using the sanitized `agent_name` (converted to `kebab-case`) with the `.mdc` extension inside the `.cursor/rules/agents/` directory. Example: `MyCoolAgent` -> `.cursor/rules/agents/my-cool-agent.mdc`.
- Prints a JSON object to stdout indicating success (`{"success": true, "message": "...", "filepath": "..."}`) or failure (`{"success": false, "error": "..."}`).
- Exits with code 0 on success, 1 on failure.

## Example Usage
```bash
# Creates .cursor/rules/agents/my-new-agent.mdc
python rules/tools/scaffold_agent.py MyNewAgent
```
