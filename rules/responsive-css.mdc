# Responsive CSS Strategy

Responsive design is primarily handled using CSS media queries within dedicated files or specific component files.

- **Component-Specific Responsive Files**: Many components have a corresponding `*-responsive.css` file within their directory (e.g., `[assets/css/components/layout/navigation/navigation-responsive.css](mdc:assets/css/components/layout/navigation/navigation-responsive.css)`). These files contain media queries targeting different viewport sizes (`min-width`, `max-width`, or range syntax) to adjust the component's layout, visibility, and styling.
- **Global Responsive Styles**: Some broader responsive adjustments might be found in files like `[assets/css/components/layout/responsive.css](mdc:assets/css/components/layout/responsive.css)`.
- **Breakpoints**: Common breakpoints used appear to be around `320px`, `480px`, `768px`, `1024px`, and `1200px`. Check specific files for exact values, often defined using CSS variables.
- **Modern Syntax**: The codebase uses modern media query syntax like `(width <= 768px)`.
