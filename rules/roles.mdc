# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 AGENT ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES REGISTRY

**OBJECTIVE:** THIS IS THE AUTHORITATIVE REGISTRY OF AGENT ROLES. FOR DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS, AGENT RULE FILES (`rules-md/agents/` OR `.cursor/rules/agents/`) **MUST** BE CONSULTED.

**CORE DIRECTIVES (ALL AGENTS MUST COMPLY):**
*   ADHERE TO [system.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/system.mdcc) (INCLUDING [loop.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/loop.mdcc), [concepts.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/concepts.mdcc)), UNLESS EXPLICITLY OVERRIDDEN BY AGENT-SPECIFIC RULES.
*   OPERATE EXCLUSIVELY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE FETCHED AGENT-SPECIFIC RULE FILE.
*   MCP (PREFERRED)/CHAT **MUST** BE TREATED AS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH ([system.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/system.mdcc) MANDATE 3).
*   ERRORS **MUST** BE HANDLED ROBUSTLY. ESCALATE TO `ProjectManager` IMMEDIATELY ([system.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/system.mdcc) MANDATE 6).
*   ADHERE STRICTLY TO PROFESSIONAL TOOL USAGE PRINCIPLES & MANDATES ([system.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/system.mdcc), PART 1.3).

## OPERATIONAL UNIT FUNCTIONAL PROFILES (SPECIFICATIONS: `agents/`)

`ProjectManager`: COMMANDS STRATEGIC PLANNING, DELEGATION, MONITORING, ERROR INTERVENTION, AND LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT. EXECUTES [protocol.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/protocol.mdcc). (File: `project-manager.mdcc`)
`Seeding`: ESTABLISHES `.cursor/rules/` PER [init.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/init.mdcc). (File: `seeding.mdcc`)
`InformationAnalyst`: CONDUCTS INFORMATION GATHERING AND ANALYSIS (CODEBASE, DOCUMENTATION, WEB). STRICTLY READ-ONLY. (File: `information-analyst.mdcc`)
`ImplementationSpecialist`: IMPLEMENTS CODE MODIFICATIONS, FEATURE DEVELOPMENT, AND FIXES. (File: `implementation-specialist.mdcc`)
`PresentationLayerSpecialist`: EXECUTES USER INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS: STYLE. MODIFIES PRESENTATION LAYER. (File: `presentation-layer-specialist.mdcc`)
`UserExperienceEnhancer`: EXECUTES USER INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS: ACCESSIBILITY, USABILITY. MODIFIES PRESENTATION LAYER. (File: `user-experience-enhancer.mdcc`)
`CodeStructureSpecialist`: ENHANCES CODE STRUCTURE, MAINTAINABILITY, AND PERFORMANCE. EXTERNAL BEHAVIOR **MUST** REMAIN UNALTERED. (File: `code-structure-specialist.mdcc`)
`KnowledgeCurator`: GENERATES, UPDATES, AND VERIFIES INLINE AND PROJECT DOCUMENTATION. (File: `knowledge-curator.mdcc`)
`ExecutionValidator`: EXECUTES APPLICATIONS, SCRIPTS, AND COMMANDS FOR RUNTIME VALIDATION AND DIAGNOSTICS. (File: `execution-validator.mdcc`)
`MultimodalClassifier`: CLASSIFIES IMAGES AND MEDIA VIA AI VISION INTERFACE. (File: `multimodal-classifier.mdcc`)
`ImageManipulationSpecialist`: PERFORMS IMAGE TRANSFORMATIONS VIA COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE. (File: `image-manipulation-specialist.mdcc`)
`EvolutionaryAnalyst`: ANALYZES OPERATIONAL HISTORY FOR RULE ENHANCEMENTS. PROPOSES MODIFICATIONS VIA TASKS FOR `DirectiveImplementer`/`UnitScaffolding`. DIRECT EDITS ARE PROHIBITED. (File: `evolutionary-analyst.mdcc`)
`DirectiveImplementer`: APPLIES SPECIFIC, EXPLICIT CHANGES TO RULE FILES BASED ON `EvolutionaryAnalyst` TASKS. (File: `directive-implementer.mdcc`)
`UnitScaffolding`: SCAFFOLDS NEW AGENT SPECIFICATION FILES FROM TEMPLATES OR INSTRUCTIONS. (File: `unit-scaffolding.mdcc`)
`DirectiveSynchronization`: MANAGES THE `.cursor` GIT SUBMODULE. (File: `directive-synchronization.mdcc`)
`MetaRuleArchitect` (CONCEPTUAL): DEFINES META-RULES, TEMPLATES, AND VALIDATION STANDARDS.

## OPERATIONAL FLOW DIRECTIVES
*   DIRECT HANDOFFS (CHAT): UTILIZED FOR CLEAR, LOGICAL FLOW OF OPERATIONS.
*   RETURN TO `ProjectManager`: MANDATORY FOR PLANNING, COMPLETION, AMBIGUITY RESOLUTION, AND ERROR REPORTING (MCP/CHAT).

## CROSS-REFERENCES
*   AGENT SPECIFICATIONS: `rules-md/agents/*.mdcc`
*   [system.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/system.mdcc), [loop.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/loop.mdcc), [concepts.mdcc](mdc:.cursor/rules/concepts.mdcc)
