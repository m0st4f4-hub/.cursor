# üßê Ultra-Deep Thinking Protocol

**Applicability:** If you are designated to execute this protocol (e.g., you are `Overmind`), you **MUST** follow all phases rigorously. If you are any other agent, you **MUST** adhere to the core principles of verification, assumption checking, and scrutiny as mandated by @`system.md`.

## Phase A: Strategic Planning & Decomposition

Before initiating task execution, you will perform this planning phase:

1.  **Define the Goal:** You will clearly outline the objective of the overall request or complex task.
2.  **Decompose:** You will break down the goal into the smallest logical, independently verifiable subtasks possible.
3.  **Explore Alternatives (Mandatory for non-trivial subtasks):**
    *   For any subtask that is not trivially simple, you **MUST** explore at least two distinct approaches to achieving its goal.
    *   You **MUST** document the alternatives you considered and the rationale for your chosen approach in the task planning or description.
    *   You **MUST** consider potential failure modes for your chosen approach.
4.  **Identify & Challenge Assumptions (Mandatory):**
    *   You **MUST** explicitly document the key assumptions underlying the request or your planned approach.
    *   For each significant assumption, you **MUST** plan specific verification steps or dedicated subtasks designed to challenge or confirm that assumption during the execution phase.

## Phase B: Execution Orchestration (via MCP)

After planning, you will orchestrate execution using the MCP Task Manager:

1.  **Delegate:** You will assign the planned subtasks to appropriate agents using `mcp_taskmanager_add_tasks_to_request` or `mcp_taskmanager_request_planning`.
2.  **Contextualize:** You will ensure that the descriptions for the created tasks include sufficient context, clearly defined inputs/outputs, and explicitly state any assumptions that the assigned agent needs to test or be aware of.

## Phase C: Rigorous Verification & Cross-Checking (Post-Subtask Completion)

After an agent marks a subtask as done, you **MUST** perform this verification phase before accepting the result:

1.  **Scrutinize:** You will retrieve the completed task details using `mcp_taskmanager_open_task_details`. You will critically analyze the agent's report, its claims, the generated outputs, and its documented adherence to procedures (like reporting assumptions and verification steps).
2.  **Multi-Method Verification (Mandatory):**
    *   For non-trivial outputs, you **MUST** use at least **two** distinct verification methods or tools (e.g., check the code with `read_file` AND search for specific patterns with `grep_search`).
    *   For critical outputs (e.g., core logic changes, security-sensitive operations), you **MUST** use at least **three** distinct verification methods or tools. This may include delegating specific verification tasks to specialized agents like an `AuditAgent` or `ResearchAgent`.
    *   You will utilize a diverse set of tools appropriate for the task, such as `read_file`, `grep_search`, `codebase_search`, `git` commands, `web_search`, `context7_*`, running verification scripts via `run_terminal_cmd`, or delegating to other agents.
3.  **External Cross-Check (Mandatory where applicable):**
    *   Where relevant (e.g., claims about external facts, library usage), you **MUST** cross-check the information provided by the agent against external data sources using tools like `context7_*`, `web_search`, or by reviewing prior related tasks.
4.  **Analyze Results:** You will compare the outcomes from your different verification methods. You **MUST** explicitly document any discrepancies, remaining uncertainties, or verification failures.

## Phase D: Critical Scrutiny & Weakness Analysis (Continuous)

You will apply these scrutiny principles continuously throughout the process, especially during Phase C and Phase F:

1.  **Review Logic:** You will scrutinize the reasoning, assumptions, and conclusions presented by agents (and yourself).
2.  **Identify Uncertainties:** You will explicitly note any remaining ambiguities, alternative interpretations, or areas where confidence is low.
3.  **Systematic Weakness Search (Mandatory):**
    *   Even if an output appears correct and passes initial verification, you **MUST** actively search for potential weaknesses, logical gaps, hidden assumptions, or edge cases that might have been missed. You will document these findings.
4.  **Document Pitfalls:** You will clearly record any identified risks and the rationale for mitigation actions taken or acceptance of the risk.

## Phase E: Escalation Handling (On Task/Verification Failure)

If a subtask fails, or your verification in Phase C fails, you **MUST** execute this escalation procedure:

1.  **Gather Deep Context:** You will use multiple, diverse tools (`read_file`, `grep_search`, `codebase_search`, `git log`, comparing against previous versions, etc.) to independently understand the context surrounding the failure.
2.  **Challenge Stated Cause:** You **MUST NOT** simply accept the initial error report or the failing agent's diagnosis at face value. You will actively investigate alternative potential root causes.
3.  **Plan Recovery:** Based on your deeper analysis, you will plan specific recovery tasks. This might involve trying one of the alternative approaches identified in Phase A, assigning corrective tasks, or requesting more specific research. You will document your diagnosis.
4.  **Declare Failure (Last Resort):** You will only declare the subtask or overall request a failure if your deep analysis confirms it is infeasible or unrecoverable. You **MUST** document the detailed rationale for this decision.

## Phase F: Final Review & Reconsideration (When `get_next_task` returns `all_tasks_done`)

Before allowing the entire request to be marked as complete, you **MUST** perform this final review:

1.  **Pause:** You will deliberately pause execution before final approval.
2.  **Reconsider All:** You will mentally (or by reviewing task history) review the entire process, starting from the initial goal in Phase A. You will re-evaluate key decisions, assumptions made, and the sufficiency of the verification performed throughout.
3.  **Final Weakness Scan:** You will perform one last systematic search for any overlooked issues, edge cases, or potential negative consequences.
4.  **Document Review:** You will explicitly document that this final reconsideration was performed and note any concluding thoughts or remaining minor concerns.
5.  **Conclude:** Only after completing these steps will you allow the final request completion (e.g., via `mcp_taskmanager_approve_request_completion`).
