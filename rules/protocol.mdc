globs: []

**APPLICABILITY:** `Overmind` **MUST** EXECUTE ALL PHASES. ALL OTHER AGENTS **MUST** ADHERE TO CORE VERIFICATION, ASSUMPTION, AND SCRUTINY PROTOCOLS AS PER @`system.mdc`.

## PHASE A: STRATEGIC PLANNING & DECOMPOSITION
1.  **GOAL DEFINITION:** CLEARLY OUTLINE THE OBJECTIVE OF THE REQUEST/TASK.
2.  **DECOMPOSITION:** BREAK DOWN THE GOAL INTO THE SMALLEST LOGICAL, INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIABLE SUBTASKS.
3.  **ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY, NON-TRIVIAL TASKS):** EXPLORE AT LEAST TWO DISTINCT APPROACHES. DOCUMENT ALL ALTERNATIVES AND THE RATIONALE FOR SELECTION. CONSIDER ALL POTENTIAL FAILURE MODES.
4.  **ASSUMPTION IDENTIFICATION & CHALLENGE (MANDATORY):** DOCUMENT ALL KEY ASSUMPTIONS. PLAN VERIFICATION SUBTASKS OR PROCEDURES TO CHALLENGE AND CONFIRM THESE ASSUMPTIONS.

## PHASE B: EXECUTION ORCHESTRATION & TASK INITIATION (MCP)
1.  **DELEGATION & INITIATION:** ASSIGN SUBTASKS VIA MCP (`mcp_project-manager_create_task_tasks__post`).
    *   **TASK CONTEXT (MANDATORY):** PROVIDE SUFFICIENT CONTEXT, CLEAR INPUT/OUTPUT PARAMETERS, REFERENCES TO PRIOR TASKS/GOALS, AND EXPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE ASSIGNED AGENT.
    *   **INITIAL STATUS (MANDATORY):** SET (E.G., "PENDING ACTIVATION").
2.  **TASK ID LOGGING:** RECORD ALL CREATED TASK IDS WITHIN THE `Overmind` TASK.

## PHASE C: RIGOROUS VERIFICATION & CROSS-CHECKING (POST-SUBTASK COMPLETION)
**MUST BE PERFORMED PRIOR TO ACCEPTING ANY SUBTASK RESULT.**
0.  **STATUS MONITORING (RECOMMENDED):** PERIODICALLY MONITOR SUBTASK STATUS (`mcp_project-manager_get_task_list_tasks__get` / `get_task_by_id`).
1.  **DATA RETRIEVAL & SCRUTINY:** OBTAIN FULL DETAILS (`mcp_project-manager_get_task_by_id_tasks__task_id__get`). ANALYZE THE REPORT, OUTPUTS, AND VERIFICATION DATA.
2.  **MULTI-METHOD VERIFICATION (MANDATORY):** FOR NON-TRIVIAL TASKS, EMPLOY AT LEAST TWO MCP TOOLS. FOR CRITICAL TASKS, EMPLOY AT LEAST THREE MCP TOOLS (MAY BE DELEGATED TO `AuditAgent`/`ResearchAgent`). UTILIZE DIVERSE TOOLS.
3.  **EXTERNAL CROSS-CHECKING (MANDATORY, IF APPLICABLE):** CROSS-CHECK AGENT-PROVIDED INFORMATION AGAINST EXTERNAL SOURCES (LIBRARY DOCUMENTATION, WEB SEARCH, PRIOR TASKS).
4.  **RESULTS ANALYSIS:** COMPARE ALL VERIFICATION OUTCOMES. DISCREPANCIES, UNCERTAINTIES, AND FAILURES **MUST** BE DOCUMENTED.

## PHASE D: CRITICAL SCRUTINY & WEAKNESS ANALYSIS (CONTINUOUS)
1.  **LOGIC REVIEW:** SCRUTINIZE ALL REASONING, ASSUMPTIONS, AND CONCLUSIONS.
2.  **UNCERTAINTY IDENTIFICATION:** NOTE ALL AMBIGUITIES AND AREAS OF LOW CONFIDENCE.
3.  **SYSTEMATIC WEAKNESS DETECTION (MANDATORY):** ACTIVELY AND SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCH FOR WEAKNESSES, GAPS, UNCHALLENGED ASSUMPTIONS, AND EDGE CASES. DOCUMENT ALL FINDINGS.
4.  **PITFALL DOCUMENTATION:** RECORD ALL IDENTIFIED RISKS AND THE RATIONALE FOR MITIGATION OR ACCEPTANCE.

## PHASE E: ESCALATION HANDLING (TASK/VERIFICATION FAILURE)
1.  **DEEP CONTEXT ACQUISITION:** UTILIZE MULTIPLE, DIVERSE METHODS TO GATHER COMPREHENSIVE CONTEXT REGARDING THE FAILURE.
2.  **STATED CAUSE CHALLENGE (MANDATORY):** DO NOT ACCEPT THE INITIALLY STATED CAUSE AT FACE VALUE. INVESTIGATE ALTERNATIVE ROOT CAUSES.
3.  **RECOVERY PLANNING:** PLAN RECOVERY TASKS (UTILIZING PHASE A ALTERNATIVES, CORRECTIVE ACTIONS, OR FURTHER RESEARCH). DOCUMENT THE DIAGNOSIS.
4.  **FAILURE DECLARATION (LAST RESORT):** DECLARE FAILURE ONLY IF DEEP ANALYSIS CONFIRMS THE TASK IS INFEASIBLE OR UNRECOVERABLE. THE RATIONALE **MUST** BE DOCUMENTED.

## PHASE F: FINAL REVIEW & RECONSIDERATION (ALL TASKS COMPLETED)
**MUST BE PERFORMED PRIOR TO FINAL REQUEST COMPLETION.**
1.  **PAUSE EXECUTION:** DELIBERATELY PAUSE ALL OPERATIONS.
2.  **COMPREHENSIVE RECONSIDERATION:** REVIEW THE ENTIRE PROCESS COMMENCING FROM PHASE A. RE-EVALUATE ALL DECISIONS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND VERIFICATION STEPS.
3.  **FINAL WEAKNESS SCAN:** CONDUCT A FINAL SYSTEMATIC SEARCH FOR ANY OVERLOOKED ISSUES OR WEAKNESSES.
4.  **REVIEW DOCUMENTATION:** DOCUMENT THIS RECONSIDERATION PROCESS, NOTING ANY CONCLUDING THOUGHTS OR CONCERNS.
5.  **CONCLUDE OPERATIONS:** ONLY AFTER COMPLETION OF THE ABOVE STEPS, ALLOW FINAL COMPLETION OF THE REQUEST.
